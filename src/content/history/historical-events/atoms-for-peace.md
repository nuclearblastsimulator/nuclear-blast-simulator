# Atoms for Peace

## The Promise of Peaceful Nuclear Technology

On December 8, 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered his "Atoms for Peace" speech to the United Nations General Assembly, proposing to share peaceful nuclear technology with the world. This historic speech marked a fundamental shift in nuclear policy from secrecy to openness, promising to harness the atom's power for human benefit rather than destruction. The initiative led to widespread nuclear technology sharing but also inadvertently contributed to nuclear weapons proliferation.

## Background

### Nuclear Monopoly Era
- **U.S. advantage**: United States held nuclear weapons monopoly 1945-1949
- **Soviet breakthrough**: USSR tested nuclear weapon in 1949
- **Arms race**: Rapid nuclear weapons development by both superpowers
