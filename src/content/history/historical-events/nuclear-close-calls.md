# Nuclear Close Calls

## Near Misses with Nuclear Catastrophe

Nuclear close calls are incidents where nuclear weapons were nearly launched or detonated accidentally, highlighting the constant risk of nuclear catastrophe through technical failures, miscommunication, or human error. Throughout the nuclear age, numerous incidents have brought the world perilously close to nuclear war or accidental nuclear detonation, often being averted only by individual heroism, last-minute discoveries, or sheer luck.
