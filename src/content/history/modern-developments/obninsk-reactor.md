# Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant

## The World's First Civilian Nuclear Power Plant

The Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant, which began operation on June 27, 1954, in Obninsk, Soviet Union, was the world's first nuclear power plant designed for civilian electricity generation. This modest 5-megawatt reactor demonstrated that nuclear technology could be harnessed for peaceful purposes, marking the beginning of the global nuclear power industry.
