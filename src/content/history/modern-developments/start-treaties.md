# START Treaties

## The Greatest Nuclear Disarmament Success

The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties (START) represent the most successful nuclear disarmament agreements in history, reducing deployed U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear warheads from over 12,000 to 1,550 each. Beginning with START I in 1991, these treaties fundamentally transformed the nuclear relationship between the world's two largest nuclear powers, moving from an era of unlimited nuclear buildup to one of structured reductions and verification.

## Background

### Cold War Nuclear Buildup
- **Massive arsenals**: U.S. and Soviet Union built enormous nuclear arsenals
- **Arms race**: Decades of nuclear competition and buildup

- **Strategic instability**: Thousands of nuclear weapons created instability

### Changing Dynamics
- **Reagan administration**: Shift from arms control to arms reduction
- **Gorbachev reforms**: Soviet reforms opened possibilities for deeper cuts
