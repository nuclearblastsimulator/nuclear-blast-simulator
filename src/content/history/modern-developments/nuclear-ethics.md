# Nuclear Ethics

## Moral Questions of the Nuclear Age

Nuclear ethics addresses the profound moral questions raised by nuclear weapons and nuclear technology. From the moment scientists realized they could harness the power of the atom for destructive purposes, philosophers, theologians, policymakers, and ordinary citizens have grappled with fundamental questions about the morality of threatening mass destruction, the ethics of nuclear deterrence, and the responsibility of nuclear-armed states. These debates touch on fundamental principles of morality, justice, and human survival.
