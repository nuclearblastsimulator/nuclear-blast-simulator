# Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty

## The First Nuclear Elimination Treaty

The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, signed by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev on December 8, 1987, was a groundbreaking arms control agreement that eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons. The treaty required both the United States and Soviet Union to destroy all ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers, along with their launchers and support equipment. This unprecedented agreement removed over 2,600 missiles from Europe and marked the first time nuclear superpowers agreed to reduce their nuclear arsenals.
