# Nuclear Abolition

## The Dream of a World Without Nuclear Weapons

The [nuclear](/history/modern-developments/nuclear-weapons-free-zones) abolition movement represents one of the most ambitious and morally urgent campaigns in human history - the complete elimination of nuclear [weapons](/terms/weapons-delivery/tactical-nuclear-weapons) from the face of the Earth. Driven by the recognition that [nuclear weapons](/terms/nuclear-effects/yield-comparison) pose an existential threat to human civilization and are fundamentally indefensible on moral grounds, abolitionists argue that only the complete elimination of these weapons can ensure human survival and create a just world order. From Nobel Peace Prize winners to world leaders, from religious figures to ordinary citizens, the movement has attracted diverse voices united by a common vision of a nuclear-weapon-free world.

<!-- SUMMARY_END -->

## Deep Dive

### The Ultimate Peace Movement

The nuclear abolition movement represents humanity's most ambitious peace campaign: the complete elimination of nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth. Born from the ashes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, this movement has evolved from the passionate pleas of atomic bomb survivors to a sophisticated global campaign involving Nobel Peace Prize winners, world leaders, religious figures, scientists, and millions of ordinary citizens united by a simple but revolutionary idea – that nuclear weapons must be abolished if humanity is to survive and thrive.

The movement's power lies not just in its moral clarity but in its practical urgency. As nuclear weapons have spread to more nations, as the risks of nuclear terrorism have grown, and as the world has witnessed numerous near-misses that could have triggered nuclear war, the abolition movement has gained new relevance and momentum. The 2017 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which entered into force in 2021, represents the culmination of decades of abolitionist advocacy and the beginning of a new phase in the campaign to eliminate nuclear weapons.

The abolition movement challenges not just the existence of nuclear weapons but the entire framework of nuclear deterrence that has dominated international security for over seven decades. It argues that true security cannot be based on the threat of mass destruction and that only by completely eliminating nuclear weapons can humanity address the existential risks these weapons pose to our species and planet.

### From Hiroshima to Global Movement

The nuclear abolition movement began in the immediate aftermath of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The hibakusha (atomic bomb survivors) became the movement's moral conscience, their testimony providing irrefutable evidence of nuclear weapons' humanitarian consequences. Their accounts of suffering, loss, and resilience have inspired generations of abolitionists and given the movement a moral authority that no amount of strategic theory can counter.

Albert Einstein, whose letter to President Roosevelt had helped initiate the Manhattan Project, became one of the first prominent advocates for nuclear abolition. His famous statement that "a new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move toward higher levels" captured the movement's core message that nuclear weapons required a fundamental transformation in how humanity approaches conflict and security.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the movement gained momentum through the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in Britain, the peace movement in the United States, and similar organizations worldwide. The atmospheric nuclear testing of this period, with its visible mushroom clouds and radioactive fallout, made nuclear weapons' dangers tangible to ordinary citizens and fueled public opposition to the nuclear arms race.

The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 marked a watershed moment for the abolition movement. The world's closest brush with nuclear war demonstrated that even rational leaders could bring humanity to the brink of destruction. The crisis showed that nuclear weapons were not just abstract instruments of deterrence but real threats to human survival that could be triggered by miscalculation, misunderstanding, or malfunction.

### The Moral Foundation

The abolition movement's moral case rests on several fundamental arguments that have remained constant throughout its history. First, nuclear weapons are inherently indiscriminate – they cannot distinguish between combatants and civilians, violating one of the most basic principles of international humanitarian law. A nuclear weapon detonated in a city would kill hundreds of thousands of people instantly, with no regard for their age, gender, nationality, or involvement in any conflict.

Second, nuclear weapons cause unnecessary suffering that extends far beyond their immediate destructive effects. The radiation from nuclear weapons causes cancers, birth defects, and other health problems that can persist for generations. The psychological trauma of nuclear attack survivors, documented extensively among the hibakusha, represents another form of unnecessary suffering that conventional weapons do not inflict.

Third, nuclear weapons threaten the very survival of human civilization. Unlike conventional weapons, which can be used in limited conflicts without threatening the entire species, nuclear weapons in sufficient numbers could end human civilization as we know it. This existential threat makes nuclear weapons qualitatively different from all other weapons and, abolitionists argue, morally indefensible.

The movement's moral arguments have been reinforced by religious traditions worldwide. The Catholic Church's pastoral letter "The Challenge of Peace" (1983) provided a sophisticated theological analysis of nuclear weapons, concluding that while nuclear deterrence might be temporarily tolerable, the ultimate goal must be abolition. Protestant churches, Buddhist organizations, Islamic scholars, and Jewish thinkers have all contributed to the religious case against nuclear weapons.

### The Security Argument

While the moral case for abolition is compelling, the movement has also developed sophisticated security arguments that challenge the conventional wisdom about nuclear deterrence. Abolitionists argue that nuclear weapons actually decrease rather than increase security by creating new risks and instabilities that did not exist before their invention.

The risk of nuclear accidents has been a central concern. The abolition movement has documented numerous incidents in which nuclear weapons were nearly used due to technical failures, human error, or misunderstandings. The 1995 incident in which Russian radar detected a U.S. scientific rocket launch and briefly put Russian nuclear forces on high alert demonstrated how close the world can come to nuclear war through simple miscommunication.

The proliferation of nuclear weapons to additional states multiplies these risks exponentially. Each new nuclear-armed state creates new possibilities for nuclear weapons use, whether through state decision-making, loss of control during political instability, or theft by non-state actors. The abolition movement argues that the only way to prevent nuclear terrorism is to eliminate nuclear weapons and secure all nuclear materials.

The movement also challenges the fundamental assumption of nuclear deterrence – that nuclear weapons prevent wars. Abolitionists point out that while nuclear weapons may have prevented direct conflicts between major powers, they have coincided with numerous proxy wars, regional conflicts, and crises that could have escalated to nuclear use. The security that nuclear weapons provide to some states comes at the cost of insecurity for others.

### The Legal Revolution

The abolition movement has increasingly focused on developing international legal frameworks to support its goals. The 1996 Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons represented a major legal victory for the movement. While the Court could not definitively conclude that nuclear weapons use would always be illegal, it unanimously found that states have an obligation to pursue nuclear disarmament in good faith.

This legal foundation provided the basis for the most significant achievement of the abolition movement: the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW). Negotiated at the United Nations in 2017, the treaty represents the first comprehensive legal instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons. The treaty prohibits the development, testing, production, stockpiling, transfer, use, and threat of use of nuclear weapons.

The TPNW emerged from the Humanitarian Initiative, a diplomatic process led by middle-power states and civil society organizations that focused on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons rather than the strategic arguments that had dominated previous disarmament discussions. Three international conferences on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons provided scientific evidence about the medical, environmental, and social consequences of nuclear weapons use.

The treaty's entry into force in January 2021 marked a historic moment for the abolition movement. While none of the nuclear-armed states have joined the treaty, its existence creates a new legal and political reality. Nuclear weapons are now prohibited under international law, creating a stigma around these weapons that did not exist before.

### The Role of Civil Society

The nuclear abolition movement has been driven primarily by civil society organizations, with the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) serving as the most prominent example. ICAN's 2017 Nobel Peace Prize recognized the crucial role that civil society has played in advancing nuclear abolition and specifically acknowledged the organization's work in achieving the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.

The movement includes diverse organizations with different approaches and constituencies. Physicians for Social Responsibility emphasizes the medical consequences of nuclear weapons, drawing on the unique authority of healthcare professionals to speak about threats to human health. The Nuclear Age Peace Foundation has provided intellectual leadership and policy analysis. Religious organizations have contributed moral authority and global networks.

The hibakusha have remained central to the movement, with their testimony providing compelling evidence of nuclear weapons' humanitarian consequences. Organizations like Nihon Hidankyo in Japan have coordinated survivor testimony and advocacy, ensuring that the voices of those who experienced nuclear weapons' effects remain heard in policy debates.

Youth organizations have brought new energy and perspectives to the movement. Young people, who will inherit the long-term consequences of current nuclear policies, have demanded action on nuclear abolition as part of broader campaigns for intergenerational justice. The integration of nuclear abolition with other global justice movements has strengthened the movement's political impact.

### Government Leadership

While the abolition movement has been primarily driven by civil society, some governments have provided crucial leadership. The Canberra Commission, established by the Australian government in 1995, brought together distinguished international figures to develop a comprehensive plan for nuclear abolition. The commission's report provided detailed recommendations for achieving a nuclear-weapon-free world.

The New Agenda Coalition, consisting of Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, and South Africa, has provided sustained diplomatic leadership on nuclear abolition issues. These middle-power states have used their positions in international forums to advance abolitionist goals and challenge the nuclear-armed states to fulfill their disarmament obligations.

The Humanitarian Initiative was led by governments including Austria, Mexico, and Norway, which hosted the three conferences on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons. These governments provided the diplomatic leadership necessary to achieve the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, working closely with civil society organizations to build support for the new legal instrument.

Local governments have also played important roles in the movement. The Mayors for Peace organization, led by the mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, has mobilized thousands of cities worldwide to support nuclear abolition. Municipal governments have passed resolutions supporting abolition, divested from nuclear weapons companies, and educated their citizens about nuclear weapons issues.

### The Opposition

The nuclear abolition movement faces significant opposition from nuclear-armed states and their allies, who argue that nuclear weapons continue to serve important security functions. The deterrence argument remains central to this opposition, with proponents arguing that nuclear weapons have prevented major wars and that their elimination would make the world more dangerous.

Nuclear-armed states have also raised practical objections to abolition, arguing that the verification challenges are insurmountable and that the risk of cheating is too great. They contend that gradual, step-by-step approaches to disarmament are more realistic than the comprehensive abolition that the movement advocates.

Allied states that depend on nuclear deterrence for their security have been particularly resistant to abolition. Countries like Germany, Japan, and South Korea, which host nuclear weapons or rely on nuclear security guarantees, have argued that abolition would leave them vulnerable to conventional or nuclear threats from adversaries.

The nuclear weapons industry has also opposed abolition, arguing that nuclear weapons provide employment and technological benefits. The economic interests involved in nuclear weapons production create powerful constituencies that resist abolition efforts.

### Technical Challenges

The abolition movement has had to address numerous technical challenges related to achieving and maintaining a nuclear-weapon-free world. Verification remains one of the most complex issues, requiring technologies and procedures to ensure that nuclear weapons have been eliminated and are not being secretly developed.

The movement has supported research into verification technologies, including improved detection systems, satellite monitoring, and inspection procedures. The development of societal verification – using civil society organizations and whistleblowers to monitor compliance – has provided additional tools for ensuring that abolition agreements are maintained.

The disposition of fissile materials presents another technical challenge. The highly enriched uranium and plutonium from dismantled nuclear weapons must be secured and disposed of safely. The movement has supported programs to convert weapons-grade materials to reactor fuel, effectively turning "swords into plowshares."

The movement has also addressed the challenge of maintaining security during the transition to a nuclear-weapon-free world. This includes developing alternative security arrangements, strengthening international law enforcement, and building the institutions necessary to maintain peace without nuclear weapons.

### Contemporary Momentum

The nuclear abolition movement has gained new momentum in recent years, driven by several factors. The entry into force of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons has created new legal and political realities that strengthen the movement's position. The treaty's existence forces nuclear-armed states to justify their weapons in the face of an international legal prohibition.

Public opinion polls consistently show majority support for nuclear abolition in most countries, including nuclear-armed states. Young people, in particular, show strong support for abolition, suggesting that generational change may favor the movement's goals. The integration of nuclear abolition with other global justice movements has broadened its political base.

The massive nuclear modernization programs underway in nuclear-armed states have provided new arguments for abolition. The development of new nuclear weapons capabilities contradicts disarmament obligations and demonstrates that nuclear-armed states are planning to retain nuclear weapons for decades to come.

Emerging technologies have created new urgency around nuclear abolition. The integration of artificial intelligence into nuclear systems, the development of cyber warfare capabilities, and the possibility of space-based weapons all create new instabilities that could trigger nuclear war. Abolitionists argue that these technologies make nuclear weapons even more dangerous and abolition even more necessary.

### The Path Forward

The nuclear abolition movement continues to evolve its strategies and approaches. The success of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons has demonstrated the power of focusing on humanitarian consequences rather than strategic arguments. The movement is now working to universalize the treaty and implement its provisions.

The movement is also developing new approaches to engaging nuclear-armed states and their allies. This includes building coalitions with security professionals, business leaders, and other influential constituencies who may be more receptive to abolition arguments than traditional foreign policy elites.

The integration of nuclear abolition with other global challenges, including climate change, poverty, and inequality, has created new opportunities for coalition building. The movement argues that the resources devoted to nuclear weapons could be better used to address these pressing challenges.

The movement continues to emphasize the voices of those most affected by nuclear weapons, including the hibakusha, indigenous peoples affected by nuclear testing, and communities near nuclear weapons facilities. These voices provide moral authority and compelling evidence of nuclear weapons' humanitarian consequences.

### Conclusion: The Moral Imperative

The nuclear abolition movement represents one of the most important moral and political campaigns of our time. Its goal – the complete elimination of nuclear weapons – may seem impossibly ambitious, but the movement's achievements demonstrate that fundamental change is possible. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons stands as proof that determined civil society advocacy can reshape international law and politics.

The movement's arguments have only grown stronger with time. The risks of nuclear accidents, proliferation, and terrorism have increased rather than decreased. The moral arguments against weapons that threaten human civilization remain as compelling as ever. The legal framework for abolition has been strengthened by the prohibition treaty and other international legal developments.

Perhaps most importantly, the movement offers hope for a different kind of world – one in which security is based on cooperation rather than the threat of mass destruction, where resources are devoted to human needs rather than instruments of annihilation, and where future generations can live without the shadow of nuclear weapons hanging over their heads.

The nuclear abolition movement faces significant challenges, but it also has significant strengths. Its moral authority, legal framework, and growing political support provide a foundation for continued progress. The movement's ultimate success may depend on factors beyond its control – political changes in nuclear-armed states, accidents or near-misses that demonstrate nuclear weapons' dangers, or the emergence of new threats that make abolition more urgent.

What is certain is that the movement will continue to advocate for its vision of a nuclear-weapon-free world. The stakes are too high and the moral case too compelling for the movement to abandon its goals. The abolition of nuclear weapons remains one of the most important challenges facing humanity, and the movement dedicated to achieving this goal represents one of our species' noblest aspirations.

The dream of a world without nuclear weapons may seem distant, but the nuclear abolition movement has shown that seemingly impossible goals can be achieved through sustained effort, moral clarity, and political commitment. The movement's ultimate success would represent not just a triumph of disarmament but a transformation of human consciousness – proof that our species can choose cooperation over competition, life over death, and hope over fear.
