# Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty

## The Cornerstone of Nuclear Governance

The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which entered into force on March 5, 1970, stands as the most widely adhered to arms control agreement in history. With 191 parties, the NPT established the global framework for preventing nuclear weapons proliferation while promoting peaceful nuclear cooperation and eventual nuclear disarmament. Despite its successes, the treaty faces ongoing challenges from nuclear proliferation, modernization programs, and questions about its long-term effectiveness.

## Background

### Nuclear Proliferation Concerns
- **Rapid spread**: Fear that nuclear weapons would spread to many countries
- **Atoms for Peace**: Eisenhower's program inadvertently aided proliferation
