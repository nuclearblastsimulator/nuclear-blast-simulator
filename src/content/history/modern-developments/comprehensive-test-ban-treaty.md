# Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty

## The Unfinished Ban

The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), signed in 1996, represents the international community's commitment to ending all nuclear weapons testing. The treaty prohibits any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion anywhere in the world. Despite widespread support with 185 signatures and 170 ratifications, the CTBT has not entered into force due to the requirement that all 44 states with nuclear technology must ratify it. The treaty established a sophisticated global monitoring system that detects nuclear explosions worldwide.
