# Shippingport Atomic Power Station

## America's Nuclear Power Pioneer

The Shippingport Atomic Power Station, which began commercial operation on December 2, 1957, was the first large-scale nuclear power plant in the United States and the world's first nuclear power plant devoted exclusively to peaceful purposes. Located in Pennsylvania along the Ohio River, Shippingport demonstrated the commercial viability of nuclear energy and launched America's nuclear power industry. The plant operated successfully for 25 years, proving that nuclear technology developed for naval propulsion could be adapted for civilian electricity generation.
