# Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty

## The First Nuclear Elimination Treaty

The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, signed by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev on December 8, 1987, was a groundbreaking arms control agreement that eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons. The treaty required both the United States and Soviet Union to destroy all ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers, along with their launchers and support equipment.

## Deep Dive

### The Treaty That Eliminated Nuclear Weapons

The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty stands as one of the most remarkable achievements in the history of arms control and the only nuclear disarmament agreement to completely eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons. Signed by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev on December 8, 1987, the treaty removed over 2,600 missiles from Europe and established unprecedented verification procedures that transformed the relationship between the United States and Soviet Union. For more than three decades, the INF Treaty served as a cornerstone of European security and a model for future arms control agreements.

The treaty's significance extends far beyond the weapons it eliminated. It marked the first time that nuclear superpowers agreed to reduce rather than simply limit their nuclear arsenals, setting a precedent for actual disarmament that would influence subsequent arms control negotiations. The agreement also demonstrated that even the most bitter adversaries could cooperate on matters of mutual security interest, paving the way for the peaceful end of the Cold War.

Yet the treaty's collapse in 2019, amid mutual accusations of violations and changing geopolitical circumstances, serves as a sobering reminder of the fragility of arms control achievements. The termination of the INF Treaty has renewed fears of a new missile arms race and highlighted the challenges of maintaining arms control agreements in an increasingly complex multipolar world.

### The Crisis That Demanded Solution

The INF Treaty emerged from one of the most serious nuclear crises of the Cold War: the "Euromissile Crisis" of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The crisis began with the Soviet Union's deployment of SS-20 intermediate-range ballistic missiles, modern, mobile, and highly accurate weapons that could strike targets throughout Western Europe from bases in the Soviet Union. Unlike previous Soviet missiles, the SS-20s were not covered by existing arms control agreements and represented a significant upgrade in Soviet nuclear capabilities.

The SS-20 deployments created a profound security dilemma for NATO. The missiles could destroy key military and civilian targets throughout Western Europe, but they could not reach the United States directly. This created what strategists called a "decoupling" threat – the possibility that the Soviet Union might use intermediate-range missiles against Europe while avoiding direct nuclear confrontation with the United States. European leaders feared that the United States might not risk nuclear war to defend Europe against intermediate-range missile attacks.

The NATO response came in the form of the "dual-track decision" of December 1979. The alliance agreed to deploy 572 new American intermediate-range missiles in Europe – 108 Pershing II ballistic missiles in West Germany and 464 ground-launched cruise missiles in the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, and Belgium. At the same time, NATO committed to serious negotiations with the Soviet Union to eliminate the need for these deployments.

The dual-track decision triggered massive protests across Europe as peace movements mobilized against the planned deployments. Millions of people participated in demonstrations, with some of the largest protests in European history taking place in London, Bonn, Rome, and other major cities. The protests reflected genuine public concern about the nuclear arms race and the specific dangers posed by intermediate-range missiles with their short flight times and high accuracy.

### Reagan's Revolutionary Proposal

Against this backdrop of crisis and protest, President Ronald Reagan made a startling proposal in a speech at the National Press Club on November 18, 1981. Reagan offered to cancel the planned deployment of American intermediate-range missiles in exchange for the Soviet Union's elimination of its SS-20s, SS-4s, and SS-5s. This "zero option" was revolutionary because it proposed eliminating an entire class of weapons rather than simply limiting their numbers.

The zero option was initially dismissed by many experts as unrealistic. The Soviet Union had already deployed hundreds of intermediate-range missiles, while the United States had yet to deploy any. The proposal seemed to ask the Soviets to give up existing capabilities in exchange for American promises not to deploy planned systems. Critics argued that the zero option was designed more for its public relations value than as a serious negotiating position.

The Soviet response was predictably negative. Soviet leaders argued that the zero option ignored the broader nuclear balance and other nuclear systems that could threaten Soviet territory. They proposed instead a moratorium on new deployments and negotiations on reductions that would account for British and French nuclear forces. The initial Soviet counterproposals were unacceptable to the United States, leading to a stalemate in negotiations.

The stalemate was briefly broken in July 1982 when the chief negotiators, Paul Nitze for the United States and Yuli Kvitsinsky for the Soviet Union, took a famous "walk in the woods" near Geneva. During this informal discussion, they developed a potential compromise that would have involved significant reductions in Soviet missiles in exchange for cancellation of the Pershing II deployments. However, both governments rejected the informal agreement, and negotiations remained deadlocked.

### The Gorbachev Revolution

The breakthrough that eventually led to the INF Treaty came with the rise of Mikhail Gorbachev as Soviet leader in March 1985. Gorbachev brought a new approach to arms control, emphasizing the need for "new thinking" about security and the importance of reducing nuclear tensions. His reforms were driven partly by the Soviet Union's economic difficulties and the unsustainable burden of military spending, but they also reflected a genuine belief that nuclear weapons posed unacceptable risks to humanity.

Gorbachev's first major arms control initiative was a unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing, announced in August 1985. This was followed by a series of proposals for nuclear reductions and a gradual shift in Soviet positions on intermediate-range missiles. The Soviet leader began to separate the INF issue from other nuclear questions, moving toward the zero option that Reagan had proposed in 1981.

The dramatic momentum toward an INF agreement accelerated after the Reykjavik Summit in October 1986. Although the summit failed to achieve Reagan's vision of eliminating all nuclear weapons, it produced significant progress on intermediate-range missiles. Gorbachev agreed to eliminate Soviet intermediate-range missiles in Europe and to include Soviet missiles in Asia, addressing American concerns about the global nature of the threat.

Perhaps most importantly, Gorbachev agreed to intrusive verification measures that would have been unthinkable under previous Soviet leaders. The Soviet Union, traditionally obsessed with secrecy, agreed to allow American inspectors to visit Soviet military facilities and to maintain a permanent presence at a Soviet missile production facility. This represented a revolutionary change in Soviet policy and demonstrated Gorbachev's commitment to reaching an agreement.

### The Verification Revolution

The INF Treaty's verification provisions were unprecedented in their scope and intrusiveness. The agreement established multiple types of inspections, including baseline inspections to verify initial declarations, elimination inspections to monitor the destruction of missiles, and special inspections to investigate suspected violations. The treaty also provided for continuous monitoring at missile production facilities, with American inspectors stationed at the Votkinsk facility in the Soviet Union and Soviet inspectors at the Magna facility in the United States.

The verification system was designed to provide confidence that both sides were complying with their obligations. Each missile was assigned a unique identifier, and elaborate procedures were developed to prevent the substitution of missiles or the concealment of prohibited activities. The agreement included detailed technical specifications for verification equipment and procedures, creating a comprehensive system for monitoring compliance.

The implementation of the verification system required unprecedented cooperation between former adversaries. American and Soviet inspectors worked together to develop procedures, share information, and resolve technical problems. The process built trust and confidence between the two sides, demonstrating that even the most sensitive military information could be shared when both sides had strong incentives to cooperate.

The success of the INF verification system had implications far beyond the treaty itself. It demonstrated that intrusive verification was technically feasible and politically acceptable, paving the way for more ambitious arms control agreements. The techniques developed for INF verification were later applied to other arms control agreements, including the START treaties and the Chemical Weapons Convention.

### The Elimination Process

The destruction of missiles under the INF Treaty was conducted with remarkable efficiency and transparency. Both sides had three years to eliminate all covered missiles, and the process was completed ahead of schedule. The United States destroyed 846 missiles, including 108 Pershing II missiles and 429 ground-launched cruise missiles. The Soviet Union destroyed 1,752 missiles, including 654 SS-20s and hundreds of shorter-range missiles.

The elimination process was conducted under the watchful eyes of inspectors from both sides. Most missiles were destroyed by explosive demolition, creating dramatic footage that was broadcast worldwide. The destruction of the missiles became a powerful symbol of the end of the Cold War and the possibility of nuclear disarmament.

The technical challenges of elimination were significant. Both sides had to develop procedures for safely destroying missiles with nuclear warheads, handling toxic propellants, and disposing of radioactive materials. The process required careful attention to environmental protection and worker safety, setting standards that would influence later disarmament efforts.

The elimination process also involved destroying launchers, support equipment, and production facilities. This comprehensive approach ensured that the weapons could not be quickly reconstituted and provided additional confidence in the permanence of the reductions. The thoroughness of the elimination process became a model for future disarmament agreements.

### Strategic and Political Impact

The INF Treaty had profound strategic and political consequences that extended far beyond the weapons it eliminated. In strategic terms, the treaty significantly reduced nuclear tensions in Europe by removing the most destabilizing weapons from the region. The elimination of intermediate-range missiles reduced the risk of nuclear war and created a more stable security environment.

The treaty also had important effects on NATO unity and cohesion. The successful completion of the dual-track decision demonstrated that the alliance could maintain unity in the face of Soviet pressure and domestic opposition. The treaty's verification provisions provided additional confidence that the Soviet Union was complying with its obligations, reducing fears of Soviet cheating.

Politically, the INF Treaty marked a turning point in U.S.-Soviet relations. The agreement demonstrated that the two superpowers could cooperate on matters of mutual interest, even during periods of broader tension. The treaty's success created momentum for further arms control negotiations and contributed to the improvement in superpower relations that ultimately led to the end of the Cold War.

The treaty also had important domestic political consequences. In the United States, the agreement helped to legitimize Reagan's approach to arms control and demonstrated that his "peace through strength" strategy could produce concrete results. In the Soviet Union, the treaty was part of Gorbachev's broader reform program and helped to demonstrate the benefits of his new thinking about security.

### European Security Transformation

The INF Treaty's impact on European security was particularly significant. The elimination of intermediate-range missiles removed a major source of instability and fear from the continent. The short flight times and high accuracy of these weapons had created a "use it or lose it" mentality that increased the risk of nuclear war during crises.

The treaty also addressed the specific concerns of European publics about nuclear weapons. The massive peace protests of the early 1980s had reflected genuine fears about the nuclear arms race and the dangers of intermediate-range missiles. The successful elimination of these weapons helped to reduce public anxiety and demonstrated that arms control could address legitimate security concerns.

The INF Treaty's verification provisions had particular importance for European security. The extensive monitoring and inspection procedures provided transparency about military activities and created confidence that both sides were complying with their obligations. This transparency helped to reduce suspicions and build trust between former adversaries.

The treaty also influenced the broader European security environment. The success of the INF negotiations contributed to the momentum for other arms control agreements, including the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty and the START treaties. The INF Treaty demonstrated that comprehensive disarmament was possible and provided a model for other negotiations.

### The Long Peace

For more than three decades, the INF Treaty helped to maintain peace and stability in Europe. The agreement eliminated a major source of nuclear tension and created a framework for ongoing cooperation between the United States and Russia. The treaty's verification provisions continued to operate even after the Cold War ended, providing transparency and confidence-building measures that outlasted the broader U.S.-Soviet relationship.

The treaty's success was evident in the absence of intermediate-range missile deployments in Europe throughout the post-Cold War period. Neither the United States nor Russia deployed ground-launched missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers, despite significant changes in the international security environment. The treaty's prohibitions became an accepted part of the European security architecture.

The INF Treaty also influenced broader norms about nuclear weapons and arms control. The agreement demonstrated that entire classes of nuclear weapons could be eliminated, setting a precedent for more ambitious disarmament efforts. The treaty's verification provisions became a model for other agreements and helped to establish norms about transparency and cooperation in arms control.

The treaty's longevity was remarkable given the dramatic changes in the international system since 1987. The end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO expansion, and the rise of new security challenges all created pressures on the agreement. Yet the treaty survived these challenges for over three decades, demonstrating the durability of well-designed arms control agreements.

### The Unraveling

The INF Treaty's collapse began with a gradual erosion of compliance and confidence between the United States and Russia. American officials began raising concerns about potential Russian violations as early as 2008, focusing on the development of what they claimed was a prohibited intermediate-range missile. These concerns intensified as U.S.-Russia relations deteriorated following the 2014 Ukraine crisis.

The specific focus of American concerns was the Russian 9M729 missile, which the United States claimed violated the treaty's range restrictions. Russia denied these allegations and countered with its own complaints about American missile defense systems in Europe, which Moscow claimed could be used to launch offensive missiles. The mutual recriminations created a spiral of mistrust that ultimately doomed the treaty.

The broader context of the treaty's collapse included several factors that had undermined its relevance. The rise of China as a major military power with a large intermediate-range missile force created questions about the wisdom of bilateral U.S.-Russian restrictions. The development of new military technologies, including hypersonic weapons and dual-use systems, created new challenges for arms control verification.

The United States formally withdrew from the INF Treaty in August 2019, following a six-month notification period required by the agreement. Russia also withdrew from the treaty, ending more than three decades of intermediate-range missile restrictions. The collapse of the treaty was mourned by arms control advocates as a significant setback for nuclear disarmament and international security.

### Lessons and Legacy

The INF Treaty's rise and fall offer important lessons about the possibilities and limitations of arms control. The treaty's success demonstrated that even the most ambitious disarmament goals could be achieved with sufficient political will, creative verification measures, and sustained commitment from both sides. The agreement showed that arms control could resolve security crises and build trust between adversaries.

The treaty's verification innovations remain relevant for future arms control efforts. The combination of on-site inspections, continuous monitoring, and cooperative procedures developed for the INF Treaty created a model that has been applied to other agreements. The technical solutions developed for INF verification continue to inform arms control negotiations and implementation.

The treaty's collapse also offers sobering lessons about the fragility of arms control achievements. Even successful agreements can be undermined by changing geopolitical circumstances, technological developments, and erosion of political commitment. The INF Treaty's demise highlights the need for continuous effort to maintain and adapt arms control agreements to changing circumstances.

Perhaps most importantly, the INF Treaty demonstrated that nuclear disarmament is possible. The complete elimination of over 2,600 missiles proved that entire classes of nuclear weapons could be eliminated with proper verification and political will. This precedent remains relevant for future disarmament efforts and provides hope that more ambitious nuclear reductions are possible.

### The Post-INF World

The collapse of the INF Treaty has created new challenges for international security and arms control. Without the treaty's restrictions, both the United States and Russia have begun developing new intermediate-range missiles, raising fears of a new arms race. The absence of verification measures has reduced transparency and increased suspicions about military developments.

The end of the INF Treaty has also created new challenges for European security. The prospect of new intermediate-range missile deployments in Europe has raised concerns among NATO allies and created new tensions with Russia. The absence of the treaty's confidence-building measures has reduced predictability and increased the risk of misunderstanding.

The broader implications of the treaty's collapse extend beyond U.S.-Russian relations. The end of the INF Treaty has undermined confidence in arms control as a tool for managing international security challenges. The collapse has also highlighted the need for new approaches to arms control that can address the challenges of a multipolar world with multiple nuclear powers.

The search for alternatives to the INF Treaty has focused on the possibility of multilateral agreements that would include other countries with intermediate-range missiles, particularly China. However, the prospects for such agreements remain uncertain, given the different security interests and strategic cultures of the various countries involved.

### Conclusion: A Monument to Possibility

The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty stands as both a monument to the possibilities of arms control and a warning about the fragility of international agreements. For more than three decades, the treaty eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons and created a framework for cooperation between former adversaries. The agreement demonstrated that even the most ambitious disarmament goals could be achieved with sufficient political will and creative solutions.

The treaty's verification innovations revolutionized arms control and created new possibilities for transparency and cooperation. The intrusive inspection procedures that seemed impossible before the INF Treaty became routine parts of international security management. The technical solutions developed for the treaty continue to inform arms control efforts and provide tools for building confidence between potential adversaries.

The treaty's success in eliminating over 2,600 missiles proved that nuclear disarmament is not just a utopian dream but a practical possibility. The complete elimination of intermediate-range missiles showed that entire classes of nuclear weapons could be removed from the world's arsenals with proper verification and sustained commitment. This precedent remains relevant for future disarmament efforts and provides hope for more ambitious nuclear reductions.

Yet the treaty's collapse in 2019 serves as a sobering reminder of the challenges facing arms control in the 21st century. The erosion of trust between the United States and Russia, the rise of new military technologies, and the emergence of new nuclear powers have created a more complex and challenging environment for arms control. The INF Treaty's demise highlights the need for new approaches to arms control that can address these evolving challenges.

The story of the INF Treaty is ultimately a story about the power of human choice. The crisis that led to the treaty was created by human decisions to deploy dangerous weapons. The solution was found through human creativity, persistence, and willingness to take risks for peace. The treaty's implementation required unprecedented cooperation between former enemies. And its collapse resulted from human failures to maintain and adapt the agreement to changing circumstances.

As the world faces new nuclear challenges, the legacy of the INF Treaty remains relevant. The agreement showed that nuclear weapons can be eliminated, that verification can build trust, and that arms control can enhance security. These lessons provide hope that humanity can find ways to reduce nuclear dangers and build a more peaceful world. The INF Treaty's greatest legacy may be its demonstration that even the most intractable security problems can be solved through patient negotiation, creative solutions, and sustained commitment to peace.
