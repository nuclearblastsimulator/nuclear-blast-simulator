## Deep Dive

### The Greatest Nuclear Disarmament Achievement

The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties (START) represent the most successful nuclear disarmament agreements in human history, achieving reductions in deployed strategic nuclear warheads from over 12,000 to 1,550 for each of the world's two largest nuclear powers. This remarkable achievement, spanning three decades and multiple treaties, fundamentally transformed the nuclear relationship between the United States and Russia, moving from an era of unlimited nuclear buildup to one of structured reductions and mutual verification.

The START process began during the final phase of the Cold War, when both superpowers recognized that their massive nuclear arsenals had created instability rather than security. The treaties that followed not only reduced nuclear weapons but also established unprecedented verification regimes that built trust and confidence between former adversaries. The success of the START process demonstrates that even the most dangerous weapons can be reduced through patient negotiation, creative verification, and sustained political commitment.

Yet the START legacy also reveals the fragility of arms control achievements. The current New START Treaty, which expires in 2026, faces an uncertain future as U.S.-Russia relations have deteriorated and new nuclear challenges have emerged. The story of START is thus both a testament to the possibilities of nuclear disarmament and a reminder of the continued challenges facing arms control in the 21st century.

### From Buildup to Breakdown

The START treaties emerged from the recognition that the nuclear arms race had created a dangerous and unsustainable situation. By the 1980s, the United States and Soviet Union had deployed over 12,000 strategic nuclear warheads each, along with thousands of tactical nuclear weapons. These arsenals were not only enormously expensive but also created strategic instabilities that increased the risk of nuclear war.

The massive nuclear buildup had created what strategists called "crisis instability" – the possibility that during a crisis, leaders might feel pressure to use nuclear weapons quickly before they could be destroyed by an enemy first strike. The combination of large arsenals, accurate missiles, and short warning times created a dangerous situation where nuclear weapons designed to prevent war might actually make war more likely.

The economic burden of maintaining these arsenals was also becoming unsustainable. The Soviet Union, in particular, was struggling with the costs of military competition with the United States. The nuclear arms race was consuming resources that could have been used for economic development, contributing to the broader economic problems that would eventually lead to the Soviet Union's collapse.

Public pressure for nuclear reductions was also growing. The peace movements of the 1980s had mobilized millions of people to demand action on nuclear disarmament. The Nuclear Freeze movement in the United States and similar movements in Europe created political pressure for leaders to move beyond arms control toward actual arms reduction.

### Reagan's Revolutionary Proposal

The breakthrough that led to START came from an unexpected source: Ronald Reagan, who had built his political career on opposition to arms control and détente with the Soviet Union. In 1982, Reagan surprised many observers by proposing not just to limit nuclear weapons but to reduce them significantly. The President's proposal for "Strategic Arms Reduction Talks" (START) marked a fundamental shift from previous arms control efforts.

Reagan's approach was revolutionary because it focused on actual reductions rather than just limiting future growth. The Strategic Arms Limitation Treaties (SALT I and SALT II) had allowed both sides to continue building nuclear weapons as long as they stayed within agreed limits. START, by contrast, would require both sides to dismantle existing weapons and reduce their arsenals to lower levels.

The Reagan administration's approach was also notable for its emphasis on verification. The President famously adopted the Russian proverb "trust but verify" as his motto for arms control, insisting that any agreement must include extensive verification measures to ensure compliance. This emphasis on verification would become a hallmark of the START process and would help build confidence between the two sides.

The initial Soviet response to Reagan's START proposal was skeptical. Soviet leaders suspected that the proposal was designed more for its propaganda value than as a serious negotiating position. The Reagan administration's simultaneous military buildup, including the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), complicated the negotiations and raised questions about American intentions.

### The Long Road to START I

The negotiations for START I proved to be extraordinarily complex and time-consuming, lasting nine years from their beginning in 1982 to the treaty's signature in 1991. The complexity arose from several factors: the technical challenges of counting and verifying nuclear weapons, the political sensitivities surrounding national security, and the changing international environment during the final years of the Cold War.

One of the most difficult issues was developing "counting rules" for different types of nuclear weapons. A single ballistic missile might carry multiple warheads, but how should it be counted? Should a bomber that could carry multiple nuclear weapons be counted as one delivery vehicle or multiple weapons? These seemingly technical questions had major strategic implications and required years of negotiation to resolve.

The verification challenge was equally complex. Both sides needed confidence that the other was complying with the treaty's provisions, but this required unprecedented access to each other's most sensitive military facilities. The negotiators had to develop procedures for inspecting missile silos, submarine bases, and bomber facilities while protecting legitimate military secrets.

The changing political environment also affected the negotiations. Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power in the Soviet Union in 1985 created new possibilities for progress, but it also introduced new uncertainties. The dramatic changes in Soviet policy, including the policy of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring), created opportunities for arms control but also raised questions about the stability of any agreements.

### START I: The Breakthrough

The START I Treaty, signed by Presidents George H.W. Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev on July 31, 1991, represented a historic breakthrough in nuclear arms control. The treaty required both sides to reduce their deployed strategic nuclear warheads to 6,000 each, a reduction of about 30% from existing levels. Even more importantly, it limited deployed delivery vehicles to 1,600 each, forcing both sides to eliminate thousands of missiles and bombers.

The treaty's verification provisions were unprecedented in their scope and intrusiveness. The agreement provided for 12 types of inspections, including baseline inspections to verify initial declarations, reentry vehicle inspections to count warheads, and elimination inspections to verify the destruction of weapons. The treaty also established a Joint Compliance and Inspection Commission to resolve disputes and oversee implementation.

The technical complexity of START I was remarkable. The treaty ran to over 700 pages, including detailed protocols and technical annexes. The agreement included complex provisions for counting different types of weapons, procedures for eliminating missiles and bombers, and detailed technical specifications for verification equipment. The treaty's complexity reflected the negotiators' determination to create a comprehensive and verifiable agreement.

The political significance of START I was equally important. The treaty represented the first time that the superpowers had agreed to reduce their nuclear arsenals rather than simply limit their growth. The agreement demonstrated that even the most dangerous weapons could be reduced through patient negotiation and creative verification.

### The Soviet Collapse and START I

The implementation of START I was complicated by the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991, just months after the treaty was signed. The Soviet Union's dissolution created an unprecedented situation: a nuclear arms control treaty had been signed with a country that no longer existed. Four former Soviet republics – Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan – had inherited Soviet nuclear weapons and facilities.

The Lisbon Protocol, signed in May 1992, extended the START I Treaty to the four successor states. Under the agreement, Russia would remain the only nuclear-armed successor state, while Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan would eliminate their nuclear weapons and join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as non-nuclear-weapon states. This arrangement required extensive negotiations and significant financial assistance from the United States.

The denuclearization of Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan was one of the most successful non-proliferation achievements of the post-Cold War era. These three countries gave up some of the world's largest nuclear arsenals in exchange for security assurances and economic assistance. The successful completion of this process demonstrated that nuclear weapons could be eliminated even in the chaotic aftermath of a superpower's collapse.

The START I implementation process was completed in 2001, with both sides achieving the treaty's reduction targets. The United States and Russia each reduced their deployed strategic warheads to 6,000 and their delivery vehicles to 1,600. The treaty's verification provisions worked effectively, with over 600 inspections conducted and no significant compliance disputes.

### START II: The Treaty That Never Was

The START II Treaty, signed by Presidents George H.W. Bush and Boris Yeltsin on January 3, 1993, was designed to build on the success of START I by achieving even deeper reductions. The treaty would have reduced deployed strategic warheads to between 3,000 and 3,500 for each side, a reduction of about 50% from START I levels. Even more importantly, START II would have eliminated the most destabilizing weapons in both arsenals.

The treaty's most significant provision was the elimination of all land-based missiles with multiple warheads (MIRVs). These weapons were considered particularly destabilizing because they created incentives for first strikes – a single missile could destroy multiple enemy missiles, making preemptive attack attractive during crises. The elimination of MIRVs would have enhanced crisis stability and reduced the risk of nuclear war.

START II also required the complete elimination of heavy missiles, particularly the Soviet SS-18 Satan, which carried up to 10 warheads and was considered the most threatening weapon in the Soviet arsenal. The treaty would have forced both sides to rely more heavily on single-warhead missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles, which are less threatening to strategic stability.

Despite these promising provisions, START II never entered into force. The treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996 but faced delays in the Russian Duma. Russian concerns about the treaty's costs and the U.S. withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty ultimately led to the treaty's abandonment. The failure of START II represented a significant setback for nuclear arms control.

### SORT: The Simplified Approach

The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT), also known as the Moscow Treaty, was signed by Presidents George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin on May 24, 2002. The treaty represented a dramatically simplified approach to nuclear arms control, abandoning the complex verification measures and detailed provisions of previous agreements in favor of a brief, flexible accord.

SORT required both sides to reduce their deployed strategic warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 by 2012. The treaty was notable for what it didn't include: no limits on delivery vehicles, no verification measures beyond those already in place under START I, and no requirements for actually destroying eliminated weapons. The treaty was also set to expire in 2012, making it a temporary rather than permanent agreement.

The simplified approach of SORT reflected the changed relationship between the United States and Russia after the Cold War. The Bush administration argued that the elaborate verification measures of previous treaties were no longer necessary given improved relations between the two countries. The flexibility built into SORT allowed both sides to structure their forces as they saw fit, without the detailed restrictions of previous agreements.

Critics argued that SORT was too weak to be effective. The treaty's lack of verification measures meant that compliance could not be monitored effectively. The absence of delivery vehicle limits meant that both sides could retain large numbers of missiles and bombers. The flexibility to store rather than destroy eliminated warheads meant that reductions could be quickly reversed.

### New START: The Reset

The New START Treaty, signed by Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev on April 8, 2010, represented an attempt to return to the more comprehensive approach of earlier agreements while achieving further reductions. The treaty was part of the Obama administration's broader "reset" in U.S.-Russia relations and reflected a renewed commitment to nuclear arms control.

New START required both sides to reduce their deployed strategic warheads to 1,550 each, about 30% below SORT levels. The treaty also limited deployed delivery vehicles to 700 each and non-deployed delivery vehicles to 800 each. These limits represented significant reductions from existing levels and required both sides to eliminate substantial numbers of weapons.

The treaty's verification provisions were updated for the 21st century while maintaining the comprehensive approach of START I. The agreement provided for 18 on-site inspections per year, telemetry exchanges, and detailed data exchanges. The verification measures were designed to provide confidence in compliance while being less intrusive than those of START I.

New START entered into force in 2011 and was implemented successfully by both sides. The treaty's central limits were achieved by 2018, with both countries reducing their deployed strategic warheads to below 1,550. The treaty's verification provisions have functioned effectively, with hundreds of inspections conducted and no significant compliance disputes.

### The Verification Revolution

The START treaties revolutionized arms control verification, establishing procedures and technologies that have become standard practice in international agreements. The verification challenge for nuclear weapons is particularly complex because these weapons are among the most sensitive military secrets, yet effective verification requires detailed knowledge of their numbers, locations, and capabilities.

The START verification system combined several different approaches. On-site inspections allowed experts to visit missile silos, submarine bases, and bomber facilities to verify compliance with treaty provisions. Data exchanges required both sides to provide detailed information about their nuclear forces, including locations, numbers, and types of weapons. National technical means of verification, including satellites and other intelligence systems, provided additional monitoring capabilities.

The verification process also included innovative technical solutions. Treaty-limited items were tagged with unique identifiers to prevent substitution or concealment. Telemetry from missile tests was shared to verify the capabilities of new weapons. Portal monitoring was used to observe activities at key facilities. These technical measures provided confidence that both sides were complying with their obligations.

The human dimension of verification was equally important. The inspection process required cooperation between former adversaries, with American and Russian experts working together to implement treaty provisions. The verification process built trust and confidence between the two sides, demonstrating that even the most sensitive military information could be shared when both sides had strong incentives to cooperate.

### Strategic and Political Impact

The START treaties had profound strategic and political consequences that extended far beyond the weapons they eliminated. Strategically, the treaties enhanced stability by reducing the numbers of nuclear weapons and eliminating the most destabilizing systems. The reductions in deployed warheads and delivery vehicles reduced the risk of nuclear war and created a more stable strategic environment.

The elimination of MIRVed land-based missiles under START II (though the treaty never entered force) and the overall reductions in nuclear forces reduced crisis instability. With fewer weapons and less capable systems, both sides had less incentive to use nuclear weapons quickly during crises. The START process also encouraged both sides to maintain more survivable nuclear forces, further enhancing stability.

Politically, the START treaties demonstrated that nuclear disarmament was possible and that former adversaries could cooperate on matters of mutual security interest. The successful implementation of START I, despite the collapse of the Soviet Union, showed that arms control agreements could survive even dramatic political changes. The treaties also established precedents for verification and cooperation that influenced other arms control agreements.

The START process also had important domestic political consequences. In the United States, the treaties helped legitimize nuclear arms control and demonstrated that reductions could be achieved without compromising national security. In Russia, the treaties provided a framework for maintaining strategic parity with the United States despite economic constraints.

### Contemporary Challenges

The START legacy faces significant challenges in the contemporary security environment. The New START Treaty is set to expire in 2026, and prospects for its extension or replacement are uncertain given the deteriorated state of U.S.-Russia relations. The war in Ukraine has further complicated arms control prospects and raised questions about the future of nuclear cooperation.

The changing international security environment also poses challenges for the START framework. The rise of China as a nuclear power with a growing arsenal raises questions about the wisdom of bilateral U.S.-Russia reductions. The development of new military technologies, including hypersonic weapons and cyber capabilities, creates new challenges for verification and strategic stability.

The erosion of the broader arms control framework has also affected START. The collapse of the INF Treaty in 2019 and the U.S. withdrawal from the Open Skies Treaty in 2020 have reduced the institutional foundation for arms control cooperation. The New START Treaty remains one of the few surviving arms control agreements between the United States and Russia.

Non-strategic nuclear weapons, which are not covered by START, have become an increasingly important issue. Russia maintains a large arsenal of tactical nuclear weapons, while the United States has a smaller but still significant force. The absence of any agreements covering these weapons has become a major gap in the arms control framework.

### Lessons and Legacy

The START experience offers important lessons about the possibilities and limitations of nuclear arms control. The treaties demonstrate that substantial reductions in nuclear weapons are possible with sufficient political will, creative verification measures, and sustained commitment from both sides. The START process shows that even the most dangerous weapons can be reduced through patient negotiation and mutual cooperation.

The verification innovations developed for START have had lasting impact on arms control and international security. The techniques for inspecting nuclear facilities, counting weapons, and building confidence between adversaries have been applied to other agreements and have become standard practice in international monitoring. The START experience demonstrates that intrusive verification can work when both sides have strong incentives to cooperate.

The START legacy also reveals the importance of sustained political commitment to arms control. The success of START I and New START contrasts with the failure of START II, highlighting how changing political circumstances can affect arms control agreements. The treaties that succeeded were those that maintained political support in both countries and adapted to changing circumstances.

Perhaps most importantly, the START experience demonstrates that nuclear disarmament is not just a utopian dream but a practical possibility. The reduction of deployed U.S. and Russian strategic warheads from over 12,000 to 1,550 each represents one of the most significant disarmament achievements in history. This experience provides hope that further reductions are possible and that the ultimate goal of nuclear elimination may be achievable.

### Conclusion: The START Success Story

The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties represent one of the most successful examples of international cooperation in the nuclear age. Over three decades, these agreements have reduced the world's largest nuclear arsenals by over 80%, eliminated thousands of delivery vehicles, and established unprecedented verification procedures. The START process has transformed the nuclear relationship between the United States and Russia from one of unlimited competition to one of structured cooperation.

The success of START demonstrates that nuclear disarmament is possible when there is sufficient political will and creative problem-solving. The treaties show that even former adversaries can cooperate on matters of mutual security interest and that the most dangerous weapons can be reduced through patient negotiation. The verification innovations developed for START have had lasting impact on arms control and international security.

Yet the START legacy also reveals the fragility of arms control achievements. The failure of START II, the temporary nature of SORT, and the uncertain future of New START all demonstrate that arms control agreements require sustained political commitment and must adapt to changing circumstances. The deterioration of U.S.-Russia relations and the emergence of new nuclear challenges create new obstacles to arms control progress.

The future of nuclear disarmament may depend on the ability to build on the START experience while addressing contemporary challenges. This may require new approaches to verification, multilateral frameworks that include other nuclear powers, and new ways of maintaining political support for arms control. The START experience provides both a model for success and a reminder of the challenges that remain.

The story of START is ultimately a story about the power of human cooperation and the possibility of reducing even the most dangerous weapons through law and diplomacy. The treaties demonstrate that nuclear weapons are not inevitable and that their numbers can be reduced through sustained effort. As the world faces new nuclear challenges, the START experience provides both inspiration and guidance for the continued pursuit of nuclear disarmament.
