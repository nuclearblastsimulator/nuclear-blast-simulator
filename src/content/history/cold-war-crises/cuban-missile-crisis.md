# Cuban Missile Crisis

## Thirteen Days That Nearly Ended the World

From October 14-28, 1962, the world came closer to nuclear war than at any other time during the Cold War. The Cuban Missile Crisis began when American spy planes discovered Soviet nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba, just 90 miles from the U.S. mainland. For thirteen terrifying days, President John F. Kennedy and Premier Nikita Khrushchev engaged in a deadly game of nuclear brinkmanship that brought humanity to the edge of annihilation.

## Background
