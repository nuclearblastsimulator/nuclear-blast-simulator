# Broken Arrows

## Nuclear Weapon Accidents and Incidents

Broken Arrows are nuclear weapon accidents involving the accidental launching, firing, detonating, theft, or loss of nuclear weapons, representing some of the most serious incidents in the nuclear age. The U.S. military has officially acknowledged 32 Broken Arrow incidents since 1950, though the actual number may be higher. These accidents highlight the inherent risks of maintaining large nuclear arsenals and the constant challenge of ensuring nuclear safety while maintaining nuclear readiness. From aircraft crashes to missile explosions, Broken Arrows demonstrate that even the most sophisticated safety systems cannot entirely eliminate the risk of nuclear accidents.
