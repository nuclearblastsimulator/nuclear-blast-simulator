# Novaya Zemlya

## The Arctic Nuclear Testing Ground

Novaya Zemlya, an Arctic archipelago in the Barents Sea, served as the Soviet Union's northern nuclear testing site from 1955 to 1990. This remote location hosted 224 nuclear tests, including the most powerful nuclear explosion in human history - the 50-megaton Tsar Bomba on October 30, 1961. The harsh Arctic environment provided isolation for testing the Soviet Union's most powerful nuclear weapons while creating long-lasting environmental contamination in one of the world's most pristine wilderness areas.
