# Nuclear Testing Health Effects

## The Human Cost of Nuclear Weapons Development

Between 1945 and 1996, over 2,000 nuclear weapons tests were conducted by nine countries, exposing millions of people worldwide to radioactive fallout. These tests released massive amounts of radioactive materials into the atmosphere, contaminating air, water, soil, and food chains across the globe.
