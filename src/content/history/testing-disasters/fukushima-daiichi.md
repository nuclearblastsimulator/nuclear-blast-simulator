# Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster

## When Nature Overwhelmed Nuclear Safety

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, which began on March 11, 2011, was triggered by a massive earthquake and tsunami that overwhelmed the safety systems of the nuclear power plant in northeastern Japan. The disaster resulted in three reactor meltdowns, massive radioactive contamination, and the evacuation of over 154,000 people. As the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl, Fukushima fundamentally changed global nuclear safety standards and energy policies while raising profound questions about nuclear power's role in a world increasingly threatened by climate change.
