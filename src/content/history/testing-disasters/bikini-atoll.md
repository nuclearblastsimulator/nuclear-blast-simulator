# Bikini Atoll

## Paradise Lost to Nuclear Testing

Bikini Atoll, a remote coral atoll in the Marshall Islands, became synonymous with nuclear testing when the United States conducted 23 nuclear tests there between 1946 and 1958. The testing program displaced the indigenous Marshallese people from their ancestral homeland and contaminated the atoll with radioactive fallout. The name "bikini" became globally known through both the nuclear tests and the swimsuit named after the atoll, but for the Marshallese people, it represents a paradise lost to the nuclear age.
