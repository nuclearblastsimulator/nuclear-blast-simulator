# Nevada Test Site

## America's Nuclear Proving Ground

From 1951 to 1992, the Nevada Test Site (now Nevada National Security Site) served as the primary location for U.S. nuclear weapons testing. Located 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas, this 1,360-square-mile facility witnessed 928 nuclear tests, including 828 underground tests and 100 atmospheric tests. The site played a crucial role in developing America's nuclear arsenal while exposing thousands of military personnel, scientists, and civilians to radioactive fallout.
