# Castle Bravo

## When Nuclear Testing Went Catastrophically Wrong

Castle Bravo, detonated on March 1, 1954, at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands, was the largest nuclear weapon ever tested by the United States. The 15-megaton hydrogen bomb explosion was more than twice the expected yield, creating a massive radioactive fallout cloud that contaminated inhabited islands, exposed the crew of a Japanese fishing vessel to lethal radiation, and caused an international incident. The test highlighted the dangers of nuclear weapons testing and contributed to growing global opposition to atmospheric nuclear testing.
