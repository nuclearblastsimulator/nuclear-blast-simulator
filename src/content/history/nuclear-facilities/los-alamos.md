# Los Alamos National Laboratory

## The Manhattan Project's Secret Headquarters

Los Alamos National Laboratory was the Manhattan Project's secret headquarters where J. Robert Oppenheimer led an international team of scientists to design and build the world's first atomic bombs. Established in 1943 on a remote mesa in northern New Mexico, Los Alamos became the epicenter of nuclear weapons development, where the physics of nuclear fission was transformed into the engineering reality of nuclear weapons. The laboratory's work culminated in the Trinity test and the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, fundamentally changing the course of human history and establishing Los Alamos as the birthplace of the nuclear age.
