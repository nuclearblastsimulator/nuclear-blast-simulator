# Lop Nur

## China's Nuclear Testing Ground

Lop Nur, a salt lake in the Taklamakan Desert of Xinjiang province, served as China's primary nuclear testing site from 1964 to 1996. This remote location in western China witnessed 45 nuclear tests, including China's first atomic bomb in 1964 and its first hydrogen bomb in 1967. The testing program established China as the world's fifth nuclear power but also exposed the indigenous Uyghur population to radioactive fallout and environmental contamination that persists today.
