# Semipalatinsk Test Site

## The Soviet Union's Nuclear Proving Ground

The Semipalatinsk Test Site, located in northeastern Kazakhstan, served as the Soviet Union's primary nuclear testing facility from 1949 to 1989. Also known as "The Polygon," this 18,500-square-kilometer site witnessed 456 nuclear tests, including the first Soviet atomic bomb test. The testing program exposed over one million people to radiation, created vast contaminated areas, and left a legacy of environmental destruction and health problems that persists today.
