# J. Robert Oppenheimer

## The Father of the Atomic Bomb

Julius Robert Oppenheimer (1904-1967) led the scientific effort to develop the world's first nuclear weapons as director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory. Known as the "father of the atomic bomb," Oppenheimer oversaw the design and construction of the weapons that ended World War II. However, he later became a prominent advocate for nuclear arms control and international cooperation, ultimately falling from grace during the Cold War when his security clearance was revoked amid accusations of communist sympathies.
