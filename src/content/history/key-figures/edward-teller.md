# Edward Teller

## The Father of the Hydrogen Bomb

Edward Teller (1908-2003) was a Hungarian-American physicist known as the "father of the hydrogen bomb" for his central role in developing thermonuclear weapons. A brilliant and controversial figure, Teller was instrumental in creating America's most powerful nuclear weapons while becoming a persistent advocate for nuclear superiority throughout the Cold War. His support for the Strategic Defense Initiative and his testimony against J. Robert Oppenheimer made him one of the most polarizing figures in the nuclear age.
