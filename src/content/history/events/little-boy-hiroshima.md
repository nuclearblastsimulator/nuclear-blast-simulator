# Little Boy - The Hiroshima Atomic Bomb

Little Boy was the code name for the first nuclear weapon used in warfare, dropped on Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945. This uranium gun-type fission bomb marked the beginning of the nuclear age and demonstrated the devastating power of atomic weapons to the world.

## Technical Specifications

### Basic Design
- **Type**: Gun-type fission weapon
- **Fissile Material**: Highly enriched uranium-235 (80+ kg)
- **Yield**: Approximately 15 kilotons TNT equivalent
- **Weight**: 4,400 kg (9,700 pounds)
- **Length**: 3.2 meters (10.5 feet)
- **Diameter**: 0.71 meters (28 inches)

### Gun-Type Mechanism

Little Boy used the simplest nuclear weapon design - a gun-type assembly method:

1. **Subcritical Masses**: Two pieces of uranium-235 below critical mass
2. **Conventional Explosive**: Cordite propellant fired uranium "bullet"
3. **Assembly**: Bullet piece shot into target piece at high velocity
4. **Supercriticality**: Combined mass exceeded critical threshold
5. **Chain Reaction**: Neutron multiplication caused nuclear explosion

## Development History

### Manhattan Project Origins

Little Boy's development began as part of the top-secret Manhattan Project during World War II:

#### Early Research (1942-1943)
- **Los Alamos Laboratory**: Weapons design headquarters
- **Oak Ridge**: Uranium enrichment facility
- **Gun-Type Concept**: Proposed as most reliable design
- **Critical Mass Calculations**: Determined uranium requirements

#### Design Challenges
- **Uranium Enrichment**: Separating U-235 from U-238
- **Critical Mass**: Calculating precise amounts needed
- **Neutron Sources**: Ensuring proper chain reaction initiation
- **Ballistics**: Achieving sufficient velocity for assembly

### Production Process

#### Uranium Enrichment at Oak Ridge
- **Electromagnetic Separation**: Calutrons separated isotopes
- **Gaseous Diffusion**: Large-scale enrichment plants
- **Thermal Diffusion**: Additional separation method
- **Final Product**: 64 kg of weapons-grade uranium-235

#### Weapon Assembly
- **Los Alamos**: Final weapon design and assembly
- **Testing**: Ballistic tests without fissile material
- **No Nuclear Test**: Gun-type design considered reliable
- **Quality Control**: Extensive safety and reliability checks

## Technical Analysis

### Gun-Type Physics

The gun-type design exploited basic nuclear physics principles:

- **Neutron Leakage**: Many neutrons escaped before fissioning
- **Predetonation Risk**: Required very high assembly velocity
- **Yield Calculation**: 15 kt from ~1 kg of fissioned uranium

### Delivery System

#### Enola Gay Mission

- **Ground Zero**: Shima Hospital area

#### Targeting Considerations
- **Air Burst**: Maximized blast damage over area
- **Weather**: Clear conditions required for visual bombing

- **Acute Radiation Syndrome**: Thousands affected within days
- **Fallout**: Radioactive debris contaminated wide area
- **Long-term Effects**: Cancer increases in survivor population

### Human Casualties

#### Immediate Deaths
- **First Day**: Estimated 70,000-80,000 deaths
- **By End of 1945**: 140,000 total deaths
- **Survival Zones**: Distance determined survival probability
- **Medical Collapse**: Hospital system completely overwhelmed

#### Hibakusha (Survivors)

## Technical Comparison

### Versus Fat Man (Nagasaki)
- **Design**: Gun-type vs. implosion-type
- **Material**: Uranium vs. plutonium
- **Efficiency**: Lower vs. higher fission efficiency

## Conclusion

Little Boy represents a pivotal moment in human history - the first use of nuclear weapons in warfare. While technically simple compared to modern nuclear weapons, its impact was profound and lasting. The bomb demonstrated the devastating power of nuclear fission, ended World War II, and launched the nuclear age.

The weapon's gun-type design, while reliable, proved inefficient and was quickly superseded by more sophisticated implosion-type weapons. However, its simplicity remains a proliferation concern, as the gun-type design is considered the easiest path to nuclear weapons for potential proliferators.

The human cost of Little Boy - the deaths, injuries, and long-term suffering of the hibakusha - serves as a powerful reminder of nuclear weapons' humanitarian consequences. Today, as thousands of far more powerful nuclear weapons exist worldwide, the lessons of Hiroshima remain more relevant than ever.
