# Nuclear Weapons Free Zones

## Regional Nuclear Disarmament

Nuclear Weapons Free Zones (NWFZs) are regional treaties that prohibit the development, manufacture, acquisition, possession, testing, or stationing of nuclear weapons within defined geographical areas. Five zones currently cover over 115 countries across Latin America, the South Pacific, Southeast Asia, Africa, and Central Asia. These zones represent grassroots nuclear disarmament efforts, demonstrating that regions can choose to remain free of nuclear weapons and create frameworks for peaceful nuclear cooperation.
