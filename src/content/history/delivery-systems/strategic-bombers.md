# Strategic Bombers

## The First Nuclear Delivery Platform

Strategic bombers were the first platforms designed to deliver nuclear weapons and remain a crucial component of nuclear deterrence. These long-range aircraft offer unique capabilities that distinguish them from ballistic missiles: they can be recalled after launch, demonstrate resolve through visible deployment, penetrate enemy defenses, and carry both nuclear and conventional weapons. From the B-29 Superfortress that dropped the first atomic bombs to modern stealth bombers, these aircraft have evolved to remain relevant in an era of intercontinental missiles and advanced air defenses.
