# USS Nautilus

## The World's First Nuclear Submarine

USS Nautilus (SSN-571), launched on January 21, 1954, was the world's first operational nuclear-powered submarine and one of the most revolutionary vessels in naval history. Powered by a nuclear reactor that eliminated the need to surface for air or refuel for months, Nautilus fundamentally changed naval warfare and demonstrated the peaceful applications of nuclear technology. The submarine's historic achievements, including the first underwater transit of the North Pole, captured global imagination and established the foundation for modern nuclear navies.
