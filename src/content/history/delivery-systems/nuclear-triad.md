# Nuclear Triad

## Three Pillars of Nuclear Deterrence

The nuclear triad is a strategic nuclear doctrine that employs three distinct delivery systems for nuclear weapons: land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and strategic bombers. This approach ensures that nuclear forces remain survivable and credible under any conceivable attack scenario, forming the foundation of nuclear deterrence strategy. Each leg of the triad offers unique advantages and limitations, creating a complementary system that has provided strategic stability for over six decades.

## Concept and Origins

### Strategic Rationale
