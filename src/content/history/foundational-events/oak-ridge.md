# Oak Ridge National Laboratory

## The Manhattan Project's Secret City

Oak Ridge National Laboratory, originally known as the Clinton Engineer Works, was the Manhattan Project's "Secret City" where massive uranium enrichment facilities produced the fissile material for the world's first atomic bombs. Built in secrecy during World War II in the hills of Tennessee, Oak Ridge became one of the most important nuclear facilities in history, employing over 75,000 people at its peak to produce enriched uranium for the Hiroshima bomb and other nuclear weapons. Today, it remains one of the world's premier nuclear research centers, continuing to advance nuclear science and technology.
