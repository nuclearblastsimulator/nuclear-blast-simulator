# Neutron Discovery

## The Missing Piece

In 1932, British physicist James Chadwick discovered the neutron, the electrically neutral particle that, along with protons, makes up atomic nuclei. This discovery completed the basic understanding of atomic structure and provided the crucial key to nuclear fission, making nuclear weapons possible. The neutron's ability to penetrate atomic nuclei without electrical repulsion made it the ideal trigger for nuclear reactions.

## Background

### Atomic Structure Mystery
- **Proton-electron model**: Early atomic models couldn't explain atomic masses
- **Mass discrepancy**: Atomic masses were roughly twice the number of protons
- **Nuclear stability**: Unclear how positively charged protons stayed together
- **Isotopes**: Different forms of elements with same charge but different mass

### James Chadwick (1891-1974)
- **Background**: British physicist, student of Ernest Rutherford
- **Expertise**: Nuclear physics and radioactivity research
- **Position**: Professor at Cambridge University
- **Motivation**: Determined to find Rutherford's theoretical neutral particle

### Previous Research
- **Rutherford's prediction**: Suggested neutral particles might exist in nuclei
- **Bothe and Becker**: Discovered mysterious radiation from beryllium bombardment
- **Joliot-Curies**: Interpreted radiation as high-energy gamma rays
- **Anomalous results**: Radiation behaved strangely for gamma rays

## The Discovery

### Experimental Setup
- **Date**: February 1932
- **Source**: Radioactive polonium emitting alpha particles
