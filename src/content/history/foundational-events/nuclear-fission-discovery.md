# Nuclear Fission Discovery

## The Splitting of the Atom

In late 1938, German chemist Otto Hahn and his assistant Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission—the splitting of atomic nuclei into smaller fragments.

### The Discovery That Split the World

In the final weeks of 1938, in a basement laboratory in Berlin, three scientists made a discovery that would fundamentally alter human civilization. Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, working at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry, found something so unexpected that they initially doubted their own careful work. Their Austrian colleague Lise Meitner, forced into exile by Nazi persecution, provided the theoretical framework that explained their startling results. Together, they had discovered nuclear fission—the splitting of atomic nuclei that would lead directly to both nuclear weapons and nuclear power.

The discovery came at a time when the world was already sliding toward another devastating war. Within months of the fission discovery, physicists around the world would recognize its implications for warfare, setting off a race to develop nuclear weapons that would define the remainder of the 20th century. Yet the same process that enabled weapons of unprecedented destruction would also offer the promise of virtually limitless clean energy, creating one of the most profound dual-use technologies in human history.

### The Scientific Quest

The path to nuclear fission began with humanity's age-old dream of transmutation—the transformation of one element into another. By the 1930s, scientists were using neutrons discovered by James Chadwick to bombard various elements, hoping to create new, heavier elements beyond uranium. Enrico Fermi and his team in Rome had been particularly active in this research, systematically irradiating elements with neutrons and analyzing the radioactive products.

When Fermi's team bombarded uranium with neutrons, they found several new radioactive substances that they initially believed to be transuranium elements—elements heavier than uranium that had never been seen before. The results were published to great acclaim, and Fermi received the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics partly for this work. However, the chemical identification of these supposed transuranium elements remained uncertain.

Otto Hahn, Fritz Strassmann, and Lise Meitner at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute decided to repeat and extend Fermi's experiments with more rigorous chemical analysis. Hahn and Meitner had been collaborating for thirty years, and Hahn was renowned as one of the world's leading radiochemists. Their goal was to definitively identify the products of neutron bombardment of uranium and to understand the nuclear processes involved.

### The Troubling Results

As 1938 progressed, Hahn and Strassmann's careful chemical analyses revealed increasingly puzzling results. Instead of finding the expected transuranium elements, they found what appeared to be much lighter elements—elements that seemed impossible to produce from uranium through any known nuclear process. The most troubling finding was the apparent presence of barium, an element with an atomic number of 56 compared to uranium's 92.

The conventional understanding of nuclear reactions suggested that bombarding uranium with neutrons should produce elements close to uranium in the periodic table. The neutron might be absorbed, creating a heavier element, or the nucleus might emit alpha particles, creating an element a few positions lighter than uranium. But barium was far too light to be explained by these processes—it was as if the uranium nucleus had somehow split roughly in half.

Hahn and Strassmann were confident in their chemical techniques, but they struggled to accept the physical implications of their results. In the scientific paradigm of the time, atomic nuclei were thought to be almost unbreakably stable. The idea that a uranium nucleus could split into two much smaller nuclei seemed to violate fundamental principles of nuclear physics.

### The Forced Exodus

The interpretation of these results was complicated by the political situation in Nazi Germany. Lise Meitner, despite her decades of collaboration with Hahn and her crucial role in the research, was forced to flee Germany in July 1938 due to Nazi persecution. As an Austrian Jew, she became vulnerable to Nazi persecution after Germany's annexation of Austria in March 1938.

Meitner's hasty departure meant that she was not present for the crucial experiments conducted in late 1938. However, Hahn continued to correspond with her, sending her the puzzling results and seeking her theoretical insight. Meitner, now working in Sweden, found herself in the unique position of trying to interpret revolutionary experimental results from afar, while dealing with the trauma of exile and the loss of her life's work.

The separation of the team at this crucial moment highlights one of the great tragedies of the Nazi period: the loss of scientific collaboration and the human cost of political persecution. Meitner's forced exile nearly cost her the recognition she deserved for her role in one of the most important discoveries in physics.

### The Christmas Revelation

The breakthrough came during the Christmas holiday of 1938, when Meitner was visited by her nephew Otto Frisch, a physicist working in Copenhagen. Hahn had just sent Meitner a letter describing the latest results, which seemed to definitively show the presence of barium among the products of uranium bombardment. Meitner and Frisch discussed these puzzling results during long walks in the Swedish countryside.

The crucial insight came when they considered the liquid drop model of the atomic nucleus, developed by Niels Bohr and others. According to this model, the atomic nucleus could be thought of as behaving like a liquid drop, held together by nuclear forces but subject to distortion and oscillation. Meitner and Frisch realized that when a uranium nucleus absorbed a neutron, it might become so distorted that the electrostatic repulsion between protons could overcome the nuclear forces holding the nucleus together.

The result would be the splitting of the nucleus into two smaller fragments—a process that would explain the presence of barium and other light elements in Hahn and Strassmann's experiments. The fragments would fly apart with enormous kinetic energy, powered by the conversion of nuclear binding energy into motion.

### The Energy Calculation

Using Einstein's mass-energy equation E=mc², Meitner and Frisch calculated that nuclear fission would release about 200 million electron volts of energy per nucleus—roughly a million times more energy than typical chemical reactions. This enormous energy release came from the conversion of a small amount of nuclear mass into energy, as the fission fragments had slightly less total mass than the original uranium nucleus.

The calculation revealed that nuclear fission could release energy on a scale previously unimaginable. A single gram of uranium undergoing complete fission would release as much energy as burning several tons of coal. This realization immediately suggested both the enormous potential of nuclear energy and the devastating possibility of nuclear weapons.

Meitner and Frisch also recognized that fission would likely produce neutrons in addition to the two main fragments. If these neutrons could trigger additional fission reactions, a self-sustaining chain reaction might be possible. The implications of this possibility were staggering—a chain reaction could release the energy of thousands of tons of conventional explosives from a relatively small amount of fissile material.

### The Race to Publish

Hahn and Strassmann published their experimental results in the German journal Naturwissenschaften on January 6, 1939, under the title "Concerning the Existence of Alkaline Earth Elements Resulting from Neutron Irradiation of Uranium." Despite the understated title, the paper's implications were revolutionary. It provided definitive chemical evidence that uranium nuclei were splitting into much lighter elements.

Meitner and Frisch quickly prepared their own paper providing the theoretical explanation for Hahn and Strassmann's results. Published in Nature on February 11, 1939, their paper "Disintegration of Uranium by Neutrons: A New Type of Nuclear Reaction" introduced the term "fission" to describe the splitting process. Frisch borrowed the term from biology, where it described the division of living cells.

The publication of these papers sent shockwaves through the international physics community. Scientists immediately recognized the revolutionary implications of nuclear fission, both for fundamental physics and for potential applications. Within weeks, laboratories around the world were conducting fission experiments, confirming and extending the initial discoveries.

### The Chain Reaction Concept

The possibility of a nuclear chain reaction was quickly recognized by several physicists, most notably Leo Szilard, who had been thinking about chain reactions since 1933. Szilard immediately understood that if fission produced neutrons, and if these neutrons could trigger additional fission reactions, an exponentially growing chain reaction might be possible.

Fermi, Szilard, and others began experimental investigations to determine whether uranium fission actually produced neutrons and, if so, how many neutrons per fission. Their experiments confirmed that fission did indeed produce neutrons—typically two or three per fission event. This discovery made the prospect of a chain reaction not just possible but probable under the right conditions.

The concept of critical mass emerged from these early studies. For a chain reaction to be self-sustaining, each fission event would need to produce at least one additional fission. This required a sufficient mass of fissile material to ensure that neutrons produced by fission had a high probability of causing additional fissions before escaping from the material or being absorbed by non-fissile nuclei.

### The Military Implications

The military implications of nuclear fission were immediately apparent to many physicists. Szilard, who had fled Nazi Germany in 1933, was particularly concerned about the possibility that Germany might develop nuclear weapons. His concerns led to the famous letter signed by Albert Einstein and sent to President Franklin Roosevelt in August 1939, warning of the possibility of German nuclear weapons and urging the United States to begin its own nuclear research program.

The letter marked the beginning of what would become the Manhattan Project, the massive Allied effort to develop nuclear weapons during World War II. The urgency of this effort was driven by the fear that Nazi Germany, where nuclear fission had been discovered, might be the first to develop nuclear weapons. This fear proved to be largely unfounded—the German nuclear program never came close to developing nuclear weapons—but it provided the motivation for the intensive Allied nuclear effort.

### The Technical Challenges

Translating the discovery of nuclear fission into practical nuclear weapons or nuclear power required solving enormous technical challenges. The most fundamental challenge was obtaining sufficient quantities of fissile material. Natural uranium consists primarily of uranium-238, which does not readily undergo fission. Only uranium-235, comprising just 0.7% of natural uranium, was readily fissile.

Separating uranium-235 from uranium-238 required developing entirely new industrial processes, as the two isotopes are chemically identical and differ only slightly in mass. The Manhattan Project pursued multiple approaches to isotope separation, including electromagnetic separation, gaseous diffusion, and thermal diffusion. Each method required massive industrial facilities and enormous expenditures of energy and resources.

An alternative approach was the production of plutonium-239, a artificial element created when uranium-238 absorbs neutrons and subsequently undergoes radioactive decay. Plutonium-239 proved to be even more fissile than uranium-235, but producing it required building nuclear reactors—a technology that itself depended on understanding and controlling nuclear chain reactions.

### The First Nuclear Reactor

The first step toward practical nuclear technology was achieving a controlled nuclear chain reaction. This milestone was reached on December 2, 1942, when Enrico Fermi's team successfully operated Chicago Pile-1, the world's first nuclear reactor. Built in a converted squash court beneath the University of Chicago's football stadium, the reactor used natural uranium fuel and graphite moderator to slow neutrons and increase the probability of fission.

Chicago Pile-1 proved that nuclear chain reactions could be controlled and sustained, providing the foundation for both nuclear weapons and nuclear power. The reactor operated at very low power—just enough to prove that the chain reaction was self-sustaining—but it demonstrated the principles that would be scaled up for plutonium production reactors and eventually for nuclear power plants.

### The Weapons Development

The development of nuclear weapons required solving two main technical challenges: producing sufficient fissile material and designing mechanisms to rapidly assemble this material into a supercritical configuration. The Manhattan Project pursued two different weapon designs based on the available fissile materials.

The uranium weapon, nicknamed "Little Boy," used a gun-type design in which one piece of uranium-235 was fired into another piece to create a supercritical mass. This design was relatively straightforward but required large amounts of highly enriched uranium. The plutonium weapon, nicknamed "Fat Man," used an implosion design in which conventional explosives compressed a subcritical mass of plutonium into a supercritical configuration.

Both weapons were successfully tested and used in warfare. The Trinity test in New Mexico on July 16, 1945, demonstrated the plutonium implosion design, while Little Boy was used without prior testing against Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. Fat Man was used against Nagasaki on August 9, 1945. These weapons demonstrated the devastating power of nuclear fission and effectively ended World War II.

### The Peaceful Applications

While nuclear fission was first applied to weapons, its potential for peaceful energy production was recognized from the beginning. The enormous energy release from fission suggested that nuclear reactors could generate electricity far more efficiently than any other known energy source. The development of nuclear power began almost immediately after the war, with the first experimental power reactors operating in the 1950s.

The first commercial nuclear power plant, Shippingport Atomic Power Station in Pennsylvania, began operation in 1957. It was based on technology developed for naval nuclear propulsion and demonstrated that nuclear fission could be safely and economically used for electricity generation. This success led to rapid expansion of nuclear power in the 1960s and 1970s, with hundreds of nuclear power plants built around the world.

Nuclear fission also found applications in scientific research, medicine, and industry. Research reactors provided intense neutron beams for studying materials and producing radioactive isotopes. Medical applications included the production of radioisotopes for cancer treatment and medical imaging. Industrial applications ranged from radiography for non-destructive testing to neutron activation analysis for determining the composition of materials.

### The Proliferation Challenge

The discovery of nuclear fission created an unprecedented challenge for international security: how to enjoy the benefits of nuclear technology while preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. The same knowledge and materials that could be used for peaceful nuclear power could also be used to develop nuclear weapons. This dual-use nature of nuclear technology has been a central challenge throughout the nuclear age.

The development of nuclear weapons by additional countries—the United Kingdom in 1952, the Soviet Union in 1949, France in 1960, China in 1964, and others—demonstrated that nuclear technology would inevitably spread. Efforts to control this proliferation led to the development of international safeguards systems and non-proliferation treaties, most notably the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968.

### The Environmental and Safety Legacy

The discovery of nuclear fission also introduced new environmental and safety challenges. Nuclear fission produces radioactive waste products that remain dangerous for thousands of years. The management of this nuclear waste has proven to be one of the most persistent challenges of the nuclear age, with no country yet implementing a permanent solution for high-level radioactive waste disposal.

Nuclear accidents, while rare, have had significant environmental and health consequences. Major accidents at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima have highlighted the potential risks of nuclear technology and the importance of maintaining high safety standards. These accidents have also influenced public perception of nuclear power and affected the development of nuclear energy programs worldwide.

### The Modern Legacy

More than 80 years after its discovery, nuclear fission continues to play a crucial role in human society. Nuclear power provides about 10% of the world's electricity and about 20% of electricity in the United States. Nuclear weapons, while reduced in number from Cold War peaks, remain a central concern in international relations and security policy.

The discovery of nuclear fission also opened the door to nuclear fusion research, which seeks to harness the energy source of the sun and stars for peaceful purposes. While fusion technology remains under development, it offers the potential for even cleaner and more abundant energy than fission.

### The Continuing Relevance

The discovery of nuclear fission remains one of the most important scientific discoveries in human history. It revealed the enormous energy locked within atomic nuclei and opened both tremendous opportunities and grave dangers for humanity. The dual-use nature of nuclear technology—its potential for both beneficial and destructive applications—continues to pose challenges for policymakers, scientists, and society as a whole.

Understanding the discovery of nuclear fission and its implications is essential for anyone seeking to comprehend the modern world. It demonstrates how scientific discovery can have far-reaching consequences that extend far beyond the laboratory, affecting international relations, energy policy, environmental protection, and the very survival of human civilization.

The story of nuclear fission discovery also highlights the importance of international scientific collaboration and the dangers of political persecution of scientists. The forced exile of Lise Meitner nearly cost her the recognition she deserved for her crucial role in the discovery, serving as a reminder of how political interference can damage scientific progress.

As we face new challenges in the 21st century, including climate change, energy security, and nuclear proliferation, the lessons of the fission discovery remain relevant. The need for responsible development and application of powerful technologies, the importance of international cooperation in managing global challenges, and the ongoing tension between scientific progress and security concerns all trace back to that momentous discovery in a Berlin laboratory in 1938.

The splitting of the uranium nucleus split more than just atoms—it split human history into the pre-nuclear and nuclear ages, forever changing our relationship with energy, warfare, and the fundamental forces of nature.
