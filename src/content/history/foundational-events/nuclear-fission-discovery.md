# Nuclear Fission Discovery

## The Splitting of the Atom

In late 1938, German chemist Otto Hahn and his assistant Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission—the splitting of atomic nuclei into smaller fragments. Their Austrian colleague Lise Meitner, forced to flee Nazi Germany, provided the crucial theoretical explanation with her nephew Otto Frisch. This discovery revealed that enormous amounts of energy could be released from atomic nuclei, directly leading to both nuclear weapons and nuclear power.

## Background

### Scientific Context
- **Neutron bombardment**: Scientists were bombarding elements with neutrons
- **Transmutation research**: Trying to create new elements heavier than uranium
- **Enrico Fermi's work**: Italian physicist had been studying neutron-induced reactions
- **Radioactive products**: Mysterious radioactive products from uranium bombardment

### Key Figures
- **Otto Hahn (1879-1968)**: German chemist, expert in radioactive elements
- **Fritz Strassmann (1902-1980)**: German chemist, Hahn's careful assistant
- **Lise Meitner (1878-1968)**: Austrian physicist, forced to flee Nazi Germany
- **Otto Frisch (1904-1979)**: British-Austrian physicist, Meitner's nephew

### Pre-Discovery Research
- **Transuranium elements**: Attempts to create elements beyond uranium
- **Neutron bombardment**: Systematic study of neutron-induced reactions
- **Chemical analysis**: Identifying radioactive products from bombardment
- **Unexplained results**: Strange chemical signatures that didn't match expectations

## The Discovery

### Experimental Work (1938)
- **Location**: Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry, Berlin
- **Method**: Bombarding uranium with neutrons
- **Chemical analysis**: Careful chemical separation of reaction products
- **Surprising result**: Found barium among the products

### The Puzzle
- **Expected products**: Scientists expected elements close to uranium
- **Actual products**: Found much lighter elements like barium
- **Chemical certainty**: Hahn and Strassmann were certain of their chemistry
- **Physical impossibility**: Couldn't explain how uranium became barium

### Meitner's Insight
- **Exile**: Meitner had fled to Sweden in July 1938
- **Correspondence**: Hahn sent results to Meitner for explanation
- **Christmas walk**: Meitner and Frisch discussed results during Christmas 1938
- **Breakthrough**: Realized the uranium nucleus was literally splitting

## Theoretical Explanation

### Liquid Drop Model
- **Nuclear model**: Nucleus behaved like a liquid drop
- **Distortion**: Neutron absorption caused nucleus to oscillate
- **Splitting**: Electrostatic repulsion overcame nuclear forces
- **Fission fragments**: Two roughly equal fragments formed

### Energy Calculation
- **Mass defect**: Fission fragments had less mass than original nucleus
- **Einstein's equation**: E=mc² converted mass difference to energy
- **Enormous energy**: About 200 million electron volts per fission
- **Energy comparison**: Millions of times more than chemical reactions

### Publication
- **Hahn and Strassmann**: Published chemical results in January 1939
- **Meitner and Frisch**: Published theoretical explanation in February 1939
- **Term "fission"**: Frisch coined the term, borrowed from biology
- **Global impact**: Results spread rapidly through physics community

## Scientific Implications
