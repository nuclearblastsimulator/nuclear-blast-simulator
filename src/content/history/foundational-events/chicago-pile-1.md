# Chicago Pile-1

## The First Nuclear Chain Reaction

On December 2, 1942, at 3:25 PM, Enrico Fermi and his team achieved the first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in human history. Built in a converted squash court beneath the University of Chicago's football stadium, Chicago Pile-1 (CP-1) proved that nuclear fission could be controlled and sustained, directly demonstrating the feasibility of nuclear weapons and nuclear power.
