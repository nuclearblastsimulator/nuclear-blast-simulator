# Discovery of Radioactivity

## The Accidental Discovery

In 1896, French physicist Henri Becquerel made a serendipitous discovery that would fundamentally change our understanding of matter and energy. While studying phosphorescence in uranium salts, Becquerel accidentally left photographic plates wrapped in black paper near uranium samples in a dark drawer. When he developed the plates days later, he found they were fogged despite never being exposed to light—revealing that uranium emitted invisible radiation spontaneously.

## Background

### Scientific Context
- **X-rays discovery**: Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays in 1895, inspiring research into radiation
- **Phosphorescence studies**: Scientists were investigating materials that glowed after light exposure
- **Atomic theory**: Atomic structure was still largely unknown in the 1890s
- **Energy conservation**: The source of this continuous energy emission was mysterious

### Henri Becquerel (1852-1908)
- **Background**: Third generation of distinguished French physicists
- **Expertise**: Specialist in phosphorescence and fluorescence
- **Position**: Professor at the École Polytechnique in Paris
- **Legacy**: Nobel Prize in Physics 1903 (shared with the Curies)

## The Experiments

### Initial Observations
- **Date**: February 26-27, 1896
- **Setup**: Uranium salts placed on photographic plates wrapped in black paper
- **Expectation**: Believed uranium needed sunlight to emit radiation
- **Surprise**: Plates were fogged even after days in darkness

### Systematic Investigation
- **Control experiments**: Tested with and without uranium samples
- **Different materials**: Tested various uranium compounds
- **Intensity measurements**: Found radiation intensity proportional to uranium content
- **Penetration tests**: Discovered radiation could penetrate thin materials

### Key Findings
- **Spontaneous emission**: Uranium emitted radiation without external energy
- **Constant intensity**: Radiation was continuous and didn't diminish over time
- **Material property**: Radiation was an inherent property of uranium atoms
- **Ionizing effect**: Radiation could discharge electrified objects

## Marie and Pierre Curie's Contributions

### Marie Curie's Research (1867-1934)
- **Doctoral thesis**: Chose to study Becquerel's mysterious uranium rays
- **Systematic approach**: Measured radiation precisely using electrometer
- **Term coined**: Introduced the term "radioactivity" in 1898
- **Element discovery**: Discovered polonium and radium in 1898

### Pierre Curie's Role (1859-1906)
- **Collaboration**: Joined wife's research on radioactive materials
- **Instrumentation**: Developed sensitive measuring equipment

### Joint Discoveries
- **Radium isolation**: Extracted one-tenth of a gram of radium from tons of ore
- **Polonium discovery**: Named after Marie's homeland, Poland
- **Radiation intensity**: Proved radiation was atomic property, not molecular
- **Medical applications**: Discovered radium's effects on living tissue
