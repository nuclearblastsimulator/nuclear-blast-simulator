# Three Mile Island

## America's Nuclear Wake-Up Call

The Three Mile Island accident on March 28, 1979, was the most serious nuclear power plant accident in United States commercial nuclear power history. A partial meltdown of the reactor core at Unit 2 of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station near Middletown, Pennsylvania, led to the release of radioactive gases and the evacuation of pregnant women and children from the surrounding area. While no deaths were directly attributed to the accident, it fundamentally changed nuclear power regulation and public perception of nuclear energy in America.
