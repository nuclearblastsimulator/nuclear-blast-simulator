# MOAB

## Mother of All Bombs

The GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb (MOAB), popularly known as the "Mother of All Bombs," is the largest non-nuclear bomb in the U.S. arsenal with an 18,700-pound explosive payload. Weighing 21,600 pounds total, the MOAB represents the pinnacle of conventional explosive technology, designed to create devastating blast effects over a wide area. Developed during the Iraq War as a psychological weapon and bunker-buster, the MOAB bridges the gap between conventional weapons and nuclear weapons, demonstrating the increasing power of non-nuclear explosives.
