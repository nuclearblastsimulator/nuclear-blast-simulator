# Nuclear Testing

## Proving the Power of the Atom

Nuclear testing has been an integral part of nuclear weapons development since the first atomic bomb test at Trinity in 1945. Over the following decades, nuclear weapon states conducted more than 2,000 nuclear tests to develop new weapons, validate designs, understand effects, and demonstrate nuclear capabilities. These tests took place in the atmosphere, underground, underwater, and in space, contaminating vast areas with radioactive fallout and affecting the health of millions of people worldwide. The era of large-scale nuclear testing largely ended with comprehensive test ban treaties, but the legacy of these tests continues to impact global health and the environment.
