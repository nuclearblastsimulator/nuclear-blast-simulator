# Fusion Weapons

## The Ultimate Weapon

Fusion weapons, also known as hydrogen bombs, thermonuclear weapons, or H-bombs, represent the most powerful weapons ever created by humanity. These weapons derive their explosive energy from nuclear fusion reactions, the same process that powers the sun and stars. With yields potentially thousands of times greater than fission weapons, fusion weapons fundamentally changed the nature of warfare and international relations, creating the possibility of destroying entire cities with a single weapon and threatening the very survival of human civilization.
