# GBU-57 MOP

## The Ultimate Bunker Buster

The GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) is the largest conventional bunker-busting bomb in the U.S. arsenal, designed to destroy deeply buried nuclear facilities and hardened command bunkers. Weighing 30,000 pounds with a 5,300-pound warhead, the MOP represents the pinnacle of conventional penetrating weapons technology, capable of penetrating over 200 feet of hardened concrete before detonation. Developed specifically to address threats from nations like Iran and North Korea that have buried their nuclear facilities deep underground, the MOP bridges the gap between conventional weapons and nuclear options.
