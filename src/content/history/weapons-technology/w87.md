# W87 Warhead

## The Minuteman III ICBM Warhead

The W87 warhead is the primary nuclear warhead deployed on the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile, representing the backbone of America's land-based strategic nuclear deterrent. With a yield of 300-475 kilotons, the W87 combines advanced thermonuclear design with enhanced safety and security features, making it one of the most sophisticated nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal. Originally developed for the Peacekeeper missile, the W87 was transferred to the Minuteman III after the Peacekeeper's retirement, ensuring the continued effectiveness of America's ICBM force.
