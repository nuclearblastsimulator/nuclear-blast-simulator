# Pakistani Nuclear Weapons

## The World's Sixth Nuclear Power

Pakistan's nuclear weapons program began in the 1970s under the leadership of scientist A.Q. Khan and culminated in nuclear tests in 1998, establishing Pakistan as the world's sixth nuclear power. Driven primarily by security concerns over India's nuclear capabilities and conventional military superiority, Pakistan developed a nuclear arsenal designed to provide minimum credible deterrence. The program represents one of the most significant proliferation challenges of the late 20th century and continues to influence South Asian security dynamics and global nonproliferation efforts.
