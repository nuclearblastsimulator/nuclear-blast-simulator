# North Korea's First Nuclear Test

## A New Nuclear Power Emerges

On October 9, 2006, at 10:35 AM local time, seismic sensors around the world detected an unusual event near P'unggye-ri in North Korea's mountainous northeast. The underground explosion, though relatively small by nuclear standards, marked North Korea's entry into the exclusive club of nuclear weapons states. This test represented the culmination of decades of nuclear development and fundamentally altered the security dynamics of Northeast Asia, triggering international condemnation and a new phase in global non-proliferation efforts.

## Background
