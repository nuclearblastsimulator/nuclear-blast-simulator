# Indian Nuclear Weapons

## The World's Fifth Nuclear Power

India's nuclear weapons program began in the 1960s under the leadership of scientists like Homi Bhabha and culminated in the 1974 "Smiling Buddha" test, making India the sixth country to demonstrate nuclear weapons capability. After a 24-year testing moratorium, India conducted the Pokhran-II series in 1998, establishing itself as a declared nuclear power with an estimated 160-170 nuclear warheads. India maintains a doctrine of credible minimum deterrence with a no-first-use policy, emphasizing defensive nuclear posture while developing a nuclear triad for strategic stability.
