# Nuclear Proliferation in the 21st Century

## New Nuclear Realities

The 21st century has witnessed significant changes in nuclear proliferation dynamics, with new countries acquiring nuclear weapons capabilities while others have abandoned their nuclear programs. From North Korea's nuclear tests to Iran's controversial nuclear program, from Pakistan and India's nuclear rivalry to Libya's disarmament, the nuclear landscape has become increasingly complex. These developments have challenged traditional non-proliferation approaches and created new diplomatic, security, and technological challenges for the international community.
