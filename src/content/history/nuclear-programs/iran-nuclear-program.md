# Tehran - Iran Nuclear Negotiations

## The Center of Nuclear Diplomacy

Tehran has been the center of Iran's nuclear program and international negotiations, from the development of nuclear capabilities to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreement and subsequent diplomatic efforts. Iran's nuclear program, begun in the 1950s with U.S. assistance under the Atoms for Peace program, has evolved into one of the most significant nuclear proliferation challenges of the 21st century. From the halls of the Iranian parliament to international negotiating venues, Tehran coordinates Iran's nuclear policy, balancing domestic political pressures with international diplomatic demands while maintaining the country's nuclear technological capabilities.
