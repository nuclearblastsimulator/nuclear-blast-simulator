# Pressurized Water Reactor

## Overview

The Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) is the most common type of nuclear reactor worldwide, accounting for about 65% of all nuclear power plants. It uses ordinary water as both coolant and neutron moderator, operating under high pressure to prevent boiling in the reactor core—a design that emerged from Admiral Rickover's nuclear navy and now powers millions of homes globally.

## Basic Design

### Primary Loop
- **Reactor pressure vessel**: Contains the nuclear fuel and control rods
- **Steam generators**: Heat exchangers that transfer heat to secondary loop
- **Primary pumps**: Circulate water through the reactor core
- **Pressurizer**: Maintains system pressure (~2,250 psi)

### Secondary Loop
- **Steam generators**: Convert feedwater to steam
- **Turbine-generator**: Steam drives turbine to produce electricity
- **Condenser**: Converts steam back to water
- **Feedwater pumps**: Return water to steam generators

## Key Features

### Water Under Pressure
- **Primary coolant**: Pressurized to ~2,250 psi (155 bar)
- **Temperature**: ~300°C (572°F) without boiling
- **Subcooled water**: Remains liquid throughout primary loop

### Two-Loop System
- **Primary loop**: Radioactive, contained within reactor building
- **Secondary loop**: Clean steam, drives turbine
- **Separation barrier**: Steam generators isolate radioactive primary water

## Safety Systems

### Engineered Safety Features
- **Emergency core cooling**: Multiple backup cooling systems
- **Containment structure**: Steel-lined concrete building
- **Control rod insertion**: Rapid shutdown capability
- **Reactor protection system**: Automatic safety responses

### Passive Safety Features
- **Negative temperature coefficient**: Reactor power decreases as temperature rises
- **Negative void coefficient**: Power decreases if water turns to steam
- **Delayed neutrons**: Allow time for control system response

## Fuel and Core Design

### Fuel Assemblies
- **Uranium dioxide pellets**: Ceramic fuel form
- **Zircaloy cladding**: Corrosion-resistant fuel rods
- **Control rod assemblies**: Neutron-absorbing materials
- **Fuel enrichment**: Typically 3-5% U-235

### Core Configuration
- **Fuel assembly array**: Usually 15×15 or 17×17 rod arrays
- **Core lifetime**: 18-24 month operating cycles
- **Refueling**: Typically 1/3 of core replaced each cycle

## Advantages

### Safety
- **Proven technology**: Decades of safe operation
- **Passive safety features**: Inherent physics provide safety margin
- **Redundant systems**: Multiple backup safety systems

### Operations
- **Load following**: Can adjust power output for grid demand
- **High availability**: Typical capacity factors >90%
- **Standardized design**: Reduced costs and improved safety

## Disadvantages

### Economics
- **High capital costs**: Expensive to build
- **Long construction times**: 5-10 years typical
- **Complex licensing**: Extensive regulatory requirements

### Technical
- **Pressure vessel limitations**: High pressure requires thick steel
- **Steam generator maintenance**: Heat exchanger tube problems
- **Neutron economy**: Water absorbs neutrons, reducing efficiency

## Variants

### Generation II
- **Westinghouse PWR**: Original commercial design
- **Framatome PWR**: French variant (N4, EPR)
- **Mitsubishi PWR**: Japanese variant

### Generation III+
- **AP1000**: Westinghouse advanced design
- **EPR**: European Pressurized Reactor
- **APR1400**: Korean advanced design

## Global Deployment

### Major PWR Countries
- **United States**: 65 operating PWRs
- **France**: 58 PWRs (standardized program)
- **China**: Rapidly expanding PWR fleet
- **South Korea**: APR1400 technology

## Relevance to Nuclear Weapons

PWR technology is relevant to weapons programs because:
- **Plutonium production**: Can produce weapons-grade plutonium
- **Enrichment capability**: Requires uranium enrichment infrastructure
- **Nuclear technology**: Demonstrates nuclear competence
- **Dual-use concern**: Peaceful nuclear technology can support weapons programs

However, commercial PWRs are not optimized for weapons material production and are subject to international safeguards and monitoring.
