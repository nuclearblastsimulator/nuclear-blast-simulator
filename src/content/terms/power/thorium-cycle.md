# Thorium Cycle

## Overview

The thorium fuel cycle is an alternative nuclear fuel cycle that uses thorium-232 as fertile material to breed uranium-233, which serves as the fissile fuel. This cycle offers several potential advantages over the conventional uranium-plutonium cycle, including greater fuel abundance, reduced long-lived waste, and enhanced proliferation resistance—representing a road not taken in nuclear power's development.

## Basic Physics

### Thorium-232 Properties
- **Fertile material**: Cannot sustain chain reaction alone
- **Neutron capture**: Absorbs neutrons to become protactinium-233
- **Decay chain**: Pa-233 → U-233 (fissile) + beta particles
- **Half-life**: Th-232 has 14.1 billion year half-life

### Breeding Process
- **Neutron absorption**: Th-232 + n → Th-233
- **Beta decay**: Th-233 → Pa-233 + β⁻ (22.3 minutes)
- **Second decay**: Pa-233 → U-233 + β⁻ (27 days)
- **Fissile production**: U-233 can sustain chain reaction

### Fuel Cycle Advantages
- **Thermal breeding**: Can breed in thermal spectrum
- **Higher breeding ratio**: Better neutron economy
