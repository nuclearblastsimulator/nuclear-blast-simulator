# Coolant

## Overview

Nuclear reactor coolant is a fluid that removes heat from the reactor core and transfers it to the power conversion system. The coolant must efficiently transport heat while maintaining nuclear, chemical, and physical stability under extreme conditions of temperature, pressure, and radiation—serving as the vital circulation system that keeps nuclear power safe and nuclear accidents catastrophic when it fails.

## Functions of Coolant

### Primary Functions
- **Heat removal**: Transport heat from fuel to steam generators
- **Temperature control**: Maintain safe fuel temperatures
- **Neutron moderation**: Some coolants also moderate neutrons
- **Neutron reflection**: Reduce neutron leakage from core

### Secondary Functions
- **Corrosion protection**: Prevent fuel cladding degradation
- **Structural support**: Hydraulic forces on fuel assemblies
- **Shielding**: Radiation protection for personnel
- **Chemical control**: Maintain proper water chemistry
