# Nuclear Electromagnetic Pulse

## Electronic Disruption from Nuclear Explosions

[Nuclear](/history/weapons-technology/nuclear-weapon-effects) electromagnetic pulse (EMP) is a burst of electromagnetic radiation from nuclear explosions that can damage or destroy electronic systems across vast areas, potentially causing widespread technological disruption.
