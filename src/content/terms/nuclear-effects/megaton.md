# Megaton

## Overview

A megaton measures [nuclear](/terms/nuclear-effects/yield-comparison) explosive yield equivalent to one million tons of TNT. This unit emerged during the hydrogen bomb era when kilotons became insufficient to describe [weapons](/terms/weapons-delivery/tactical-nuclear-weapons) that could destroy entire regions.

## Definition and Scale

The megaton represents massive destructive power:
- **Equivalence**: One million tons of TNT
- **Comparison**: 1,000 times larger than a kiloton
- **Symbol**: MT (megaton)
- **First use**: Hydrogen bomb era (1950s)

## Historical Development

The megaton scale emerged with thermonuclear weapons:
- **Ivy Mike (1952)**: First true hydrogen bomb at 10.4 megatons
- **Tsar Bomba (1961)**: Largest ever tested at 50 megatons
- **Arms race**: Both superpowers developed megaton-class weapons
- **Peak era**: 1950s-1960s saw largest yields

## Destructive Effects

Megaton weapons cause unprecedented destruction:
- **Fireball**: Miles in diameter
- **Blast radius**: Devastation across dozens of square miles
- **Thermal radiation**: Third-degree burns at 5+ miles
- **Fallout**: Contamination over thousands of square miles

## Physical Comparison

Megaton yields dwarf earlier weapons:
- **Hiroshima**: 15 kilotons (0.015 megatons)
- **Nagasaki**: 20 kilotons (0.020 megatons)
- **Ivy Mike**: 10.4 megatons (693 times Hiroshima)
- **Tsar Bomba**: 50 megatons (3,333 times Hiroshima)

## Modern Weapons

Contemporary arsenals contain megaton-class weapons:
- **Miniaturization**: Powerful warheads in small packages
- **Efficiency**: Higher yield-to-weight ratios
- **Deployment**: ICBMs and SLBMs carry megaton warheads
- **Strategic role**: City-busting capability

## Measurement Standards

Megaton yields are measured through various methods:
- **TNT equivalent**: Standard comparison unit
- **Seismic detection**: Earthquake-like signatures
- **Atmospheric testing**: Historical yield determination
- **Computer modeling**: Modern yield calculations

## Relevance to Nuclear Weapons

Megatons are crucial to understanding [nuclear weapons](/history/modern-developments/nuclear-weapons-free-zones) because:
- They represent the ultimate destructive capability
- Single weapons can destroy entire metropolitan areas
- They demonstrate the leap from conventional to nuclear warfare
- They illustrate why nuclear war cannot be "won" in traditional terms
