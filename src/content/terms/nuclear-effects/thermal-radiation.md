# Thermal Radiation

Thermal radiation is the intense burst of heat and light energy released during a nuclear explosion. This energy travels at the speed of light and is the first effect experienced from a nuclear detonation, causing severe burns and igniting fires over vast areas.

<!-- SUMMARY_END -->

## The Physics of Thermal Radiation

When a nuclear weapon detonates, it creates a fireball with temperatures exceeding 100 million degrees Celsius - hotter than the core of the sun. This extreme temperature causes the emission of electromagnetic radiation across the entire spectrum, with peak intensity in the visible and infrared ranges.

### Energy Distribution
- **35% of total weapon energy** is released as thermal radiation
- **UV radiation**: Causes immediate skin damage
- **Visible light**: Creates the blinding flash
- **Infrared radiation**: Primary cause of burns and fires

## Thermal Effects by Distance

The intensity of thermal radiation decreases with the square of distance from the explosion:

### Close Range (0-2 km for 1 MT weapon)
- **Thermal flux**: >1000 cal/cm²
- **Effects**: Complete vaporization of organic material
- **Infrastructure**: Spontaneous ignition of all combustibles
- **Human impact**: Instantaneous death

### Medium Range (2-8 km for 1 MT weapon)
- **Thermal flux**: 20-1000 cal/cm²
- **Effects**: Third-degree burns on exposed skin
- **Infrastructure**: Widespread fires, melting of plastics
- **Human impact**: Severe to fatal burns

### Extended Range (8-20 km for 1 MT weapon)
- **Thermal flux**: 5-20 cal/cm²
- **Effects**: Second-degree burns, temporary blindness
- **Infrastructure**: Paper and fabric ignition
- **Human impact**: Serious but survivable injuries

## Factors Affecting Thermal Radiation

### 1. Atmospheric Conditions
- **Clear weather**: Maximum thermal transmission
- **Fog/clouds**: Significant absorption and scattering
- **Humidity**: Reduces effective range
- **Dust/smoke**: Can block thermal energy

### 2. Time of Day
- **Daytime**: Pupils contracted, less eye damage
- **Nighttime**: Dilated pupils increase retinal burns
- **Dawn/dusk**: Variable effects

### 3. Weapon Design
- **Enhanced radiation weapons**: Optimized for thermal output
- **Standard weapons**: ~35% thermal energy
- **Height of burst**: Affects ground-level intensity

## Types of Thermal Injuries

### Flash Burns
- **Cause**: Direct exposure to thermal pulse
- **Characteristics**: Affect only exposed skin facing the explosion
- **Profile burns**: Shadow patterns from objects blocking radiation

### Flame Burns
- **Cause**: Secondary fires ignited by thermal radiation
- **Duration**: Continue long after initial blast
- **Severity**: Often more extensive than flash burns

### Eye Injuries
- **Flash blindness**: Temporary, from visible light overload
- **Retinal burns**: Permanent damage from focused thermal energy
- **Range**: Can occur at distances where other effects are minimal

## Fire Effects

Thermal radiation can create massive fire damage through:

### Primary Ignition
- Direct ignition of flammable materials
- Curtains, paper, dry vegetation catch fire instantly
- Creates numerous simultaneous ignition points

### Mass Fires
- **Firestorm**: Intense fire creating its own wind system
- **Conflagration**: Large area fire spreading with prevailing winds
- **Fire-generated weather**: Can spread damage beyond blast zone

## Protection from Thermal Radiation

### Immediate Actions
1. **Duck and cover**: Any barrier blocks thermal radiation
2. **Avoid windows**: Prevent flash burns and flying glass
3. **Drop to ground**: Reduce exposed body area
4. **Close eyes**: Prevent flash blindness

### Protective Factors
- **Distance**: Doubling distance reduces intensity by 75%
- **Shielding**: Any opaque object provides protection
- **Clothing**: Light-colored, loose-fitting clothes reflect heat
- **Terrain**: Hills, buildings create shadows

## Historical Cases

### Hiroshima and Nagasaki
- Flash burns accounted for 20-30% of deaths
- "Shadow" imprints left by vaporized victims
- Fires merged into firestorm within 20 minutes
- Dark clothing patterns burned into skin

### Nuclear Testing
- Operation Castle tests demonstrated unexpected thermal ranges
- Observers at "safe" distances suffered retinal burns
- Forest fires started up to 35 km from ground zero

## Modern Implications

### Urban Vulnerability
Modern cities are particularly vulnerable due to:
- Glass-faced buildings acting as kindling
- Dense fuel loads in structures
- Limited firefighting capability post-blast
- Potential for super-fires in metropolitan areas

### Medical Response
- Burn treatment facilities quickly overwhelmed
- Limited supplies for extensive burn care
- Triage protocols for mass thermal casualties
- Long-term care requirements for survivors

## Comparison with Other Effects

While blast effects cause most immediate structural damage, thermal radiation:
- Acts instantaneously at light speed
- Affects much larger areas for burns
- Creates long-lasting fire damage
- Can be blocked by simple barriers

Understanding thermal radiation effects is essential for emergency planning and illustrates why nuclear weapons create uniquely devastating humanitarian consequences beyond their explosive power.
