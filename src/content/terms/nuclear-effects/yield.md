# Yield

## Overview

Nuclear yield measures a weapon's explosive power in TNT equivalent, typically expressed in kilotons (thousands of tons of TNT) or megatons (millions of tons). This measurement quantifies the total energy release from nuclear fission and fusion reactions.

## Units of Measurement

Nuclear yield uses standardized units:
- **Kiloton (kt)**: Equivalent to 1,000 tons of TNT
- **Megaton (Mt)**: Equivalent to 1,000,000 tons of TNT
- **Energy release**: 1 kiloton = 4.184 × 10¹² joules
- **Comparison**: Hiroshima bomb was 15 kilotons

## Historical Examples

Major nuclear weapons demonstrate yield ranges:
- **Little Boy (Hiroshima)**: 15 kilotons
- **Fat Man (Nagasaki)**: 20 kilotons
- **Castle Bravo**: 15 megatons (expected 5 megatons)
- **Tsar Bomba**: 50 megatons (largest ever tested)

## Modern Weapons

Current nuclear arsenals contain various yield ranges:
- **Tactical weapons**: 0.3-50 kilotons
- **Strategic warheads**: 100 kilotons to 1.5 megatons
- **Largest deployed**: Up to 25 megatons
- **Efficiency**: Modern weapons achieve 600-2,200 kt per ton of device weight

## Yield Factors

Several factors determine nuclear yield:
- **Fissile material**: Amount and quality of uranium/plutonium
- **Weapon design**: Implosion efficiency and compression
- **Fusion stage**: Thermonuclear weapons add hydrogen fusion
- **Tamper**: Materials that reflect neutrons back into core

## Weapon Types by Yield

Different weapons serve different purposes:
- **Artillery shells**: 0.1-1 kiloton
- **Submarine missiles**: 100-475 kilotons
- **ICBMs**: 300 kilotons to 1.2 megatons
- **Gravity bombs**: Up to 25 megatons

## Scaling Effects

Yield affects damage in predictable ways:
- **Blast radius**: Scales with cube root of yield
- **Thermal radiation**: Scales with square root of yield
- **Fallout area**: Proportional to yield for surface bursts
- **EMP effects**: Increase with yield and altitude

## Yield vs. Weight

Nuclear weapons show dramatic miniaturization:
- **Early weapons**: 4-15 kilotons per ton of device weight
- **Modern weapons**: 600-2,200 kilotons per ton
- **Warhead size**: MIRV warheads weigh 200-500 kg each
- **Delivery efficiency**: Higher yield-to-weight ratios enable multiple warheads

## Relevance to Nuclear Weapons

Yield is crucial to nuclear weapons because:
- Determines the scale of destruction and casualties
- Affects weapon delivery requirements and targeting strategy
- Influences deterrence calculations and arms control treaties
- Scales weapon effects from tactical to strategic levels
