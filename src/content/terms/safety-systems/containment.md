# Containment

## Overview

Nuclear containment is a critical safety system designed to prevent the release of radioactive materials to the environment during normal operation and accident conditions. It serves as the final barrier between the reactor and the public, containing radioactive materials even in the event of severe accidentsâ€”a massive concrete and steel fortress that can mean the difference between a manageable incident and a nuclear catastrophe.

## Primary Functions

### Barrier Function
- **Radioactive confinement**: Prevent release of fission products
- **Pressure containment**: Withstand internal pressure from accidents
- **Structural integrity**: Maintain barrier function under extreme conditions
- **Leak limitation**: Minimize uncontrolled radioactive release

### Design Requirements
- **Pressure capability**: Withstand design basis accident pressures
- **Temperature resistance**: Maintain integrity at high temperatures
- **Radiation shielding**: Protect personnel and environment
- **Structural strength**: Resist external and internal forces

## Containment Types

### Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) Containment

#### Large Dry Containment
- **Single large structure**: Steel-lined concrete shell
- **Design pressure**: Typically 45-60 psig
- **Free air volume**: Large internal volume for pressure reduction
- **Passive cooling**: Natural heat removal

#### Ice Condenser Containment
- **Pressure suppression**: Ice melts to condense steam
- **Compact design**: Smaller containment structure
- **Active systems**: Fans circulate air through ice
- **Lower design pressure**: Typically 10-15 psig

#### Subatmospheric Containment
- **Negative pressure**: Maintained below atmospheric pressure
- **Leak reduction**: Inward leakage instead of outward
- **Ventilation systems**: Maintain negative pressure
- **Filtered exhaust**: Cleanup systems for any releases

### Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) Containment

#### Mark I Containment
- **Pressure suppression**: Steam condensed in suppression pool
- **Compact design**: Smaller containment structure
- **Wetwell/Drywell**: Separation of reactor and suppression pool
- **Vent systems**: Pressure relief capability

#### Mark II Containment
- **Improved design**: Larger suppression pool
- **Better access**: Improved maintenance capability
- **Enhanced systems**: Upgraded safety systems
- **Pressure relief**: Multiple vent paths

#### Mark III Containment
- **Large containment**: Similar to PWR dry containment
- **Suppression pool**: Pressure suppression capability
- **Improved access**: Better maintenance and inspection
- **Enhanced safety**: Multiple safety systems

## Containment Systems

### Structural Systems

## Design Basis Accidents

### Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA)
- **Pressure transient**: Steam and hydrogen generation
- **Temperature rise**: Heat from decay and metal-water reaction
- **Fission product release**: Radioactive material inventory
- **Hydrogen production**: Potential combustion risk

### Steam Line Break
- **Pressure increase**: Steam release into containment

- **Interfacing systems LOCA**: Bypass of containment
- **Isolation failure**: Failure to close isolation valves
- **Leakage paths**: Uncontrolled release routes

## Severe Accident Considerations

### Core Melt Accidents
- **Containment pressure**: Extreme pressure conditions
- **High temperatures**: Molten core attack on containment
- **Hydrogen generation**: Large quantities from metal-water reaction
- **Fission product release**: Massive radioactive inventory

### Containment Failure Modes
- **Overpressure**: Pressure exceeds design limits
- **Thermal attack**: High temperature degradation
- **Hydrogen explosion**: Rapid pressure increase
- **Basemat melt-through**: Molten core penetration

## Containment Performance

### Leak Rate Testing
- **Integrated leak rate test**: Overall containment leakage
- **Local leak rate test**: Individual penetration testing
- **Periodic testing**: Regular verification of integrity
- **Acceptance criteria**: Maximum allowable leakage

### Structural Integrity

## Relevance to Nuclear Weapons

Containment technology is relevant to nuclear weapons in several ways:
- **Reactor containment**: Protecting plutonium production facilities
- **Waste containment**: Managing radioactive waste from weapons production
- **Accident prevention**: Protecting weapons facilities from releases
- **Environmental protection**: Preventing contamination

However, containment is fundamentally a safety and environmental protection technology, not a weapons technology.
