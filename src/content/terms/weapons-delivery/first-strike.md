# First Strike

## Overview

A [nuclear](/terms/nuclear-effects/yield-comparison) [first](/history/nuclear-programs/north-korea-first-test) strike is a preemptive attack designed to destroy an enemy's nuclear [weapons](/terms/weapons-delivery/tactical-nuclear-weapons) before they can be used in retaliation. This strategy attempts to prevent nuclear retaliation by eliminating the opponent's nuclear capabilities in a surprise attack.

## Strategic Concept

First strike doctrine is based on specific assumptions:
- **Preemption**: Attacking before the enemy can launch
- **Counterforce**: Targeting weapons rather than cities
- **Damage limitation**: Reducing enemy retaliation capability
- **Surprise**: Achieving strategic advantage through timing

## Target Categories

First strike plans typically target:
- **ICBM silos**: Fixed missile launch sites
- **Submarine bases**: Naval nuclear facilities
- **Bomber bases**: Strategic aviation facilities
- **Command centers**: Nuclear command and control
- **Early warning**: Radar and satellite systems

## Tactical Requirements

Successful first strike requires:
- **Accuracy**: Precise targeting of hardened sites
- **Timing**: Coordinated simultaneous attacks
- **Intelligence**: Real-time enemy force locations
- **Penetration**: Overcoming defensive systems
- **Speed**: Faster than enemy response time

## Counterstrategies

Nations develop responses to first strike threats:
- **Launch on warning**: Firing upon detecting attack
- **Mobile systems**: Moving targets to avoid targeting
- **Hardened silos**: Reinforced missile protection
- **Submarine deterrent**: Hidden sea-based forces
- **Dead hand systems**: Automated retaliation

## Stability Paradox

First strike capabilities create instability:
- **Arms racing**: Competing first strike systems
- **Crisis instability**: Incentive to strike first
- **Accident risks**: Hair-trigger alert systems
- **Escalation pressure**: Use-or-lose mentality

## Technical Challenges

First strike faces major obstacles:
- **Simultaneous coordination**: Attacking all targets at once
- **Hardened targets**: Surviving weapons in reinforced sites
- **Mobile systems**: Locating and targeting moving launchers
- **Submarine tracking**: Finding hidden sea-based deterrent
- **Retaliation assurance**: Eliminating all response capability

## Modern Developments

Contemporary first strike considerations include:
- **Hypersonic weapons**: Faster, harder-to-intercept systems
- **Cyber warfare**: Disrupting command and control
- **Conventional precision**: Non-nuclear counterforce weapons
- **Missile defense**: Intercepting surviving weapons
- **Space assets**: Targeting satellites and communications

## Relevance to Nuclear Weapons

First strike doctrine is significant because:
- It drives nuclear force structure and sizing
- It creates pressure for rapid nuclear response
- It influences crisis stability and escalation risks
- It shapes arms control and verification requirements
