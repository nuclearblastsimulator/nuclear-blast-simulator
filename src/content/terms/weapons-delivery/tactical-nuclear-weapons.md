# Tactical Nuclear Weapons

## Overview

Tactical [nuclear](/terms/nuclear-effects/yield-comparison) [weapons](/history/modern-developments/nuclear-weapons-free-zones) are smaller, shorter-range [nuclear weapons](/history/nuclear-programs/nuclear-weapons-by-country) designed for battlefield use rather than strategic targets. With yields typically under 100 kilotons, they are intended for military formations and infrastructure while supposedly limiting civilian casualties.

## Technical Characteristics

Tactical nuclear weapons have distinct features:
- **Yield**: Typically 0.1-100 kilotons
- **Range**: Less than 500 kilometers
- **Targets**: Military formations, naval fleets, infrastructure
- **Delivery**: Artillery, missiles, aircraft, torpedoes
- **Portability**: Smaller and more mobile than strategic weapons

## Weapon Types

Various tactical nuclear systems exist:
- **Artillery shells**: Nuclear rounds for howitzers and cannons
- **Short-range missiles**: Battlefield ballistic missiles
- **Torpedoes**: Submarine and surface vessel weapons
- **Depth charges**: Anti-submarine warfare weapons
- **Atomic demolition munitions**: Engineered obstacles and denial

## Deployment Doctrine

Tactical nuclear weapons serve specific military roles:
- **Battlefield dominance**: Destroying enemy formations
- **Force multiplication**: Compensating for conventional weakness
- **Escalation control**: Providing "limited" nuclear options
- **Deterrence**: Preventing conventional attacks

## Current Arsenals

Major tactical nuclear deployments include:
- **Russia**: ~2,000 tactical warheads across services
- **United States**: ~200 tactical weapons in Europe
- **China**: Unknown number of tactical systems
- **Pakistan**: Short-range battlefield nuclear weapons
- **India**: Developing tactical nuclear capabilities

## Safety and Security

Tactical weapons present unique risks:
- **Reduced security**: Often deployed with field units
- **Simplified controls**: Fewer safety systems than strategic weapons
- **Theft potential**: Smaller size increases portability
- **Command authority**: Lower-level authorization possible

## Escalation Risks

Tactical nuclear weapons create escalation dangers:
- **Lower threshold**: Easier to authorize "limited" use
- **Battlefield integration**: Commanders may view as conventional
- **Retaliation uncertainty**: Difficult to limit nuclear exchange
- **Proliferation**: Technology spreads to more actors

## Relevance to Nuclear Weapons

Tactical nuclear weapons are significant because:
- They lower the threshold for nuclear use
- They blur the line between conventional and nuclear warfare
- They increase risks of [nuclear terrorism](/history/modern-developments/nuclear-terrorism)
- They complicate arms control verification
