# ICBM

## Overview

An Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) is a long-range missile capable of delivering nuclear warheads across distances exceeding 5,500 kilometers. These weapons can strike targets anywhere on Earth within 30 minutes, fundamentally transforming global security.

## Technical Specifications

Modern ICBMs have distinct characteristics:
- **Range**: 5,500+ km (3,400+ miles) minimum
- **Speed**: Exceed 15,000 mph at peak velocity
- **Accuracy**: Within hundreds of feet of target
- **Payload**: Single or multiple nuclear warheads
- **Launch time**: Minutes from command to launch

## Trajectory Phases

ICBM flight consists of three phases:
- **Boost phase**: Rocket acceleration through atmosphere (3-5 minutes)
- **Midcourse phase**: Ballistic flight through space (up to 25 minutes)
- **Terminal phase**: Warhead descent and detonation (2-3 minutes)

## Deployment Methods

ICBMs are deployed in various configurations:
- **Silo-based**: Underground reinforced concrete silos
- **Mobile launchers**: Road or rail-mobile systems
- **Submarine-launched**: Sea-based ballistic missiles (SLBMs)
- **Aircraft-delivered**: Air-launched ballistic missiles

## Major Systems

Current and historical ICBM systems include:
- **Minuteman III** (US): 450 deployed missiles
- **RS-28 Sarmat** (Russia): Heavy liquid-fueled ICBM
- **DF-41** (China): Road-mobile solid-fueled missile
- **Hwasong-15** (North Korea): Demonstrated intercontinental range

## Command and Control

ICBM operations require multiple safeguards:
- **Two-person rule**: Multiple operators required for launch
- **Permissive Action Links**: Electronic locks preventing unauthorized use
- **Communication systems**: Secure links to national command authority
- **Launch windows**: Compressed decision-making timeframes

## Relevance to Nuclear Weapons

ICBMs are critical to nuclear strategy because:
- They enable global nuclear deterrence
- Their speed compresses decision-making time
- They provide assured retaliation capability
- They represent the most survivable delivery system for land-based forces
