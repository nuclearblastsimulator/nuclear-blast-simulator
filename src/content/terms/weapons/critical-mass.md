# Critical Mass

## Overview

Critical mass is the minimum amount of fissile material needed to sustain a nuclear chain reaction. It represents the precise threshold where atomic energy becomes self-perpetuating, determining whether nuclear material produces controlled power or explosive destruction.

## Physics of Critical Mass

### Neutron Multiplication
- **Chain reaction**: Each fission must produce at least one neutron that causes another fission
- **Multiplication factor (k)**: Must equal or exceed 1.0 for sustained reaction
- **Subcritical**: k < 1 (reaction dies out)
- **Critical**: k = 1 (steady-state reaction)
- **Supercritical**: k > 1 (reaction grows exponentially)

### Neutron Economy
- **Neutron production**: 2-3 neutrons released per fission
- **Neutron absorption**: Non-fissile materials absorb neutrons
- **Neutron leakage**: Neutrons escaping the system
- **Neutron moderation**: Slowing neutrons increases fission probability

## Factors Affecting Critical Mass

### Material Properties
- **Fissile isotope**: U-235, Pu-239, U-233
- **Enrichment level**: Higher enrichment reduces critical mass
- **Density**: Compressed material has lower critical mass
- **Isotopic composition**: Presence of fertile materials

### Geometry and Configuration
- **Shape**: Sphere has lowest critical mass
- **Surface area**: More surface increases neutron leakage
- **Reflector**: Neutron reflectors reduce critical mass by ~50%
- **Tamper**: Dense materials reflect neutrons back

## Critical Mass Values

### Bare Spheres (no reflector)
- **U-235 (weapon-grade)**: ~52 kg
- **Pu-239**: ~10 kg
- **U-233**: ~16 kg

### With Reflector
- **U-235**: ~25 kg
- **Pu-239**: ~5 kg
- **U-233**: ~8 kg

## Nuclear Weapon Applications

### Gun-Type Design
- **Mechanism**: Two subcritical masses fired together
- **Material**: Requires highly enriched uranium
- **Efficiency**: Less efficient than implosion designs
- **Simplicity**: Simpler engineering but larger critical mass

### Implosion Design
- **Mechanism**: Subcritical sphere compressed to supercritical density
- **Materials**: Works with plutonium or uranium
- **Efficiency**: More efficient use of fissile material
- **Complexity**: Requires precise timing and compression

## Safety Considerations

### Criticality Accidents
- **Definition**: Accidental achievement of critical mass
- **Prevention**: Safety margins in industrial processes
- **Geometry control**: Preventing optimal shapes during handling
- **Neutron poisons**: Materials that absorb neutrons

### Industrial Safety
- **Mass limits**: Keeping quantities well below critical mass
- **Shape restrictions**: Avoiding spherical configurations
- **Moderation control**: Preventing neutron thermalization
- **Administrative controls**: Procedures and training

## Relevance to Nuclear Weapons

Critical mass is fundamental to nuclear weapons because it determines the minimum amount of fissile material needed for nuclear explosions. Understanding critical mass helps explain weapon design challenges, proliferation concerns, and why certain nuclear materials are more dangerous than others. It also explains why nuclear weapons require precise engineering to achieve supercriticality rapidly enough for explosive yields.
