# Plutonium

## Overview

Plutonium is a radioactive, man-made element that serves as the primary fissile material in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors. Created in nuclear reactors through neutron bombardment of uranium-238, plutonium-239 can sustain nuclear chain reactions with smaller critical masses than uranium-235.

## Physical Properties

Plutonium exhibits unique characteristics:
- **Atomic number**: 94 (94 protons)
- **Density**: 19.8 g/cm³ (very dense metal)
- **Melting point**: 640°C (1,184°F)
- **Appearance**: Silvery metal that tarnishes to olive green
- **Isotopes**: Multiple isotopes, with Pu-239 most important for weapons

## Production Methods

Plutonium is produced artificially through nuclear processes:
- **Reactor production**: Uranium-238 captures neutrons to become Pu-239
- **Chemical separation**: Plutonium extracted from irradiated uranium fuel
- **Weapons-grade**: Requires high concentration of Pu-239 isotope
- **Reactor-grade**: Contains higher percentages of other plutonium isotopes

## Toxicity and Health Effects

Plutonium poses severe health risks:
- **Alpha radiation**: Emits alpha particles that damage tissue
- **Inhalation hazard**: Most dangerous when inhaled as particles
- **Bone and liver**: Accumulates in bones and liver tissue
- **Cancer risk**: Causes lung, bone, and liver cancers
- **External safety**: Alpha radiation cannot penetrate skin

## Nuclear Weapons Applications

Plutonium enables compact nuclear weapons:
- **Critical mass**: Only 4-6 kg needed for weapons (vs. 15-20 kg uranium)
- **Implosion design**: Fat Man bomb used plutonium implosion
- **Weapon efficiency**: Higher yield per unit mass than uranium
- **Proliferation concern**: Easier to weaponize than uranium-235

## Nuclear Power Applications

Plutonium has civilian nuclear uses:
- **Breeder reactors**: Create more fuel than they consume
- **MOX fuel**: Mixed oxide fuel combines plutonium with uranium
- **Energy potential**: Can provide thousands of years of energy
- **Fuel recycling**: Extracted from spent nuclear fuel

## Environmental Impact

Plutonium contamination affects large areas:
- **Hanford site**: 54 million gallons of radioactive waste
- **Rocky Flats**: Contaminated soil around former weapons plant
- **Marshall Islands**: Fallout from nuclear testing
- **Mayak facility**: Severe contamination in Russia

## Global Stockpiles

Worldwide plutonium inventories present security challenges:
- **Total stocks**: Over 500 tons of separated plutonium
- **Weapons material**: Enough for 100,000+ nuclear weapons
- **Civilian stocks**: Japan holds 47 tons for reactor programs
- **Security concerns**: Theft and terrorism risks

## Relevance to Nuclear Weapons

Plutonium is crucial to nuclear weapons because:
- Lower critical mass enables smaller, more efficient weapons
- Produced in nuclear reactors, making it accessible to many nations
- Dual-use nature creates proliferation risks in civilian programs
- Long half-life (24,000 years) creates lasting security challenges
