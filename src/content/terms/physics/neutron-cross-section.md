# Neutron Cross Section

## Overview

Neutron cross section is a measure of the probability that a neutron will interact with an atomic nucleus. It's expressed in units called "barns" (1 barn = 10⁻²⁴ cm²), representing the effective "target area" a nucleus presents to an incoming neutron—a concept that determines whether nuclear reactors generate power or nuclear weapons explode.

## Types of Interactions

### Absorption Cross Section
- **Radiative capture**: Neutron absorbed, gamma ray emitted
- **Fission**: Neutron absorbed, nucleus splits
- **Charged particle emission**: Neutron absorbed, proton or alpha particle emitted

### Scattering Cross Section
- **Elastic scattering**: Neutron bounces off, no energy loss
- **Inelastic scattering**: Neutron bounces off, some energy lost

## Energy Dependence

Cross sections vary dramatically with neutron energy:

### Thermal Neutrons (~0.025 eV)
- **U-235 fission**: ~580 barns
- **Pu-239 fission**: ~750 barns
- **U-238 absorption**: ~2.7 barns

### Fast Neutrons (~1 MeV)
- **U-235 fission**: ~1.2 barns
- **Pu-239 fission**: ~1.8 barns
- **U-238 fission**: ~0.5 barns

## Resonance Peaks

Many isotopes show resonance peaks where cross sections increase dramatically at specific energies:
- **U-238**: Major resonance at 6.7 eV
- **Pu-240**: Strong resonance at 1.0 eV
- **Xe-135**: Enormous thermal absorption (~2.6 million barns)

## Practical Applications

### Reactor Design
- **Fuel enrichment**: Optimizing fissile isotope concentration
- **Control rods**: Materials with high absorption cross sections
- **Moderator choice**: Balancing absorption and scattering

### Nuclear Weapons
- **Criticality calculations**: Determining critical mass
- **Neutron reflectors**: Materials that scatter neutrons back
- **Tamper materials**: High-density materials to compress core

## Key Materials

### High Fission Cross Section
- **U-235**: Excellent thermal fission cross section
- **Pu-239**: High fission cross section at all energies
- **U-233**: Superior thermal fission properties

### High Absorption Cross Section
- **Boron-10**: 3,840 barns (thermal)
- **Cadmium**: 2,520 barns (thermal)
- **Gadolinium**: 49,000 barns (thermal)

### Good Moderators (High Scattering, Low Absorption)
- **Water**: Good scattering, moderate absorption
- **Heavy water**: Excellent scattering, very low absorption
- **Graphite**: Good scattering, low absorption

## Measurement and Calculation

Cross sections are determined through:
- **Experimental measurement**: Neutron beam experiments
- **Theoretical calculation**: Nuclear physics models
- **Evaluated data libraries**: ENDF/B, JEFF, JENDL

## Relevance to Nuclear Weapons

Understanding neutron cross sections is crucial for:
- **Critical mass calculations**: Determining weapon requirements
- **Neutron multiplication**: Optimizing chain reactions
- **Material selection**: Choosing appropriate isotopes and reflectors
- **Weapon efficiency**: Maximizing energy release
