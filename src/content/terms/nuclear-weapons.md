# Nuclear Weapons

Nuclear weapons are the most powerful and destructive devices ever created by humanity, deriving their explosive force from nuclear reactions - either [fission](/terms/fission) (splitting atomic nuclei) or a combination of fission and [fusion](/terms/fusion) (joining atomic nuclei). A single modern nuclear weapon can obliterate an entire city, kill millions of people, and render vast areas uninhabitable for decades. Since their [first use in 1945](/history/hiroshima-nagasaki), nuclear weapons have fundamentally shaped international relations, military strategy, and the very survival prospects of human civilization.

## What Are Nuclear Weapons?

### Basic Definition

Nuclear weapons are explosive devices that release energy through nuclear reactions rather than chemical explosives. The energy release from nuclear reactions is millions of times more powerful per unit mass than conventional explosives:

- **TNT explosive**: 4.6 megajoules per kilogram
- **Nuclear fission**: 82,000,000 megajoules per kilogram
- **Nuclear fusion**: 330,000,000 megajoules per kilogram

This enormous energy density allows a weapon weighing just a few hundred kilograms to level an entire city.

### Fundamental Physics

Nuclear weapons exploit two physical phenomena:

#### Nuclear Fission
- Splitting heavy atomic nuclei ([uranium-235](/terms/weapons/enrichment) or [plutonium-239](/terms/weapons/plutonium))
- Releases energy from converting matter to energy (E=mc²)
- Each fission releases ~200 MeV of energy
- Creates chain reaction when neutrons split more nuclei

#### Nuclear Fusion
- Combining light nuclei (hydrogen isotopes)
- Requires extreme temperatures (100 million degrees)
- Releases even more energy per unit mass
- Powers the sun and stars

## Types of Nuclear Weapons

### Fission Weapons (Atomic Bombs)

The first nuclear weapons relied solely on fission:

#### Gun-Type Fission Weapons
- **Mechanism**: Shoots one subcritical mass into another
- **Fissile material**: Only works with [highly enriched uranium](/terms/weapons/enrichment)
- **Simplicity**: Relatively simple design but inefficient
- **Example**: [Little Boy](/history/hiroshima-nagasaki) (Hiroshima) - 15 kilotons
- **Efficiency**: Less than 2% of uranium actually fissioned

#### Implosion-Type Fission Weapons
- **Mechanism**: Explosives compress plutonium core to supercriticality
- **Fissile material**: Works with plutonium or uranium
- **Complexity**: Requires precise explosive lens design
- **Example**: [Fat Man](/history/hiroshima-nagasaki) (Nagasaki) - 21 kilotons
- **Efficiency**: More efficient than gun-type

### Thermonuclear Weapons (Hydrogen Bombs)

Modern strategic weapons use staged radiation implosion:

#### Two-Stage Design (Teller-Ulam)
- **Primary stage**: Fission bomb provides X-rays
- **Secondary stage**: X-rays compress and heat fusion fuel
- **Yield**: 100 kilotons to multiple megatons
- **Efficiency**: Much higher energy-to-weight ratio

#### Three-Stage Weapons
- **Additional stage**: Third fusion stage for extreme yields
- **Example**: [Tsar Bomba](/history/testing/tsar-bomba-novaya-zemlya) (50 megatons tested, 100 megaton design)
- **Purpose**: City-destroying strategic weapons

### Specialized Nuclear Weapons

#### Enhanced Radiation Weapons (Neutron Bombs)
- **Design**: Minimizes blast, maximizes neutron radiation
- **Purpose**: Kill personnel while preserving infrastructure
- **Yield**: Typically 1-10 kilotons
- **Controversy**: "Capitalist bomb" that saves property

#### Variable Yield Weapons (Dial-a-Yield)
- **Feature**: Adjustable explosive yield
- **Range**: From sub-kiloton to hundreds of kilotons
- **Method**: Varying fusion fuel or boost gas amount
- **Example**: B61 bomb (0.3 to 340 kilotons)

#### Earth Penetrating Weapons (Bunker Busters)
- **Design**: Reinforced casing for ground penetration
- **Purpose**: Destroy hardened underground targets
- **Example**: B61-11 penetrator
- **Effectiveness**: Couples more energy into ground shock

## How Nuclear Weapons Work

### The Chain Reaction

Nuclear weapons require achieving a self-sustaining chain reaction:

1. **Neutron generation**: Initial neutrons start the process
2. **Fission events**: Neutrons split nuclei, releasing 2-3 new neutrons
3. **Exponential growth**: Each generation doubles reactions
4. **Energy release**: Mass converts to energy via E=mc²

### [Critical Mass](/terms/weapons/critical-mass) and Geometry

#### Critical Mass Concept
The minimum amount of fissile material needed for chain reaction:
- **Bare sphere uranium-235**: 52 kilograms
- **Bare sphere plutonium-239**: 10 kilograms
- **With neutron reflector**: Reduces by factor of 2-3
- **With compression**: Further reduces requirements

#### Subcritical to Supercritical
- **Subcritical**: Chain reaction dies out
- **Critical**: Exactly self-sustaining
- **Supercritical**: Exponential growth leading to explosion
- **Prompt critical**: Growth on neutron timescales (nanoseconds)

### Weapon Assembly Methods

#### Gun Assembly
```
[Subcritical U-235 "bullet"] ====> [Subcritical U-235 target]
                                    |
                              [Supercritical mass]
```

#### Implosion Assembly
```
     [Explosive lenses]
          |||||||
    [Plutonium core] => [Compressed supercritical core]
          |||||||
     [Explosive lenses]
```

### Boosting and Staging

#### Fusion Boosting
- **Method**: Inject deuterium-tritium gas into fission core
- **Effect**: Fusion neutrons increase fission efficiency
- **Improvement**: 2-5x yield increase
- **Standard**: Used in all modern weapons

#### Radiation Implosion (Teller-Ulam)
- **X-ray energy**: Primary's X-rays channeled by radiation case
- **Ablation**: X-rays vaporize secondary's surface
- **Compression**: Ablation pressure implodes fusion fuel
- **Ignition**: Fission "sparkplug" starts fusion burn

## Conclusion

Nuclear weapons represent humanity's ability to harness the fundamental forces of nature for destruction on an unprecedented scale. Understanding these weapons - their physics, effects, and the strategies surrounding them - remains essential for informed citizenship in a world where thousands of these devices continue to exist. While they have not been used in warfare since 1945, nuclear weapons continue to shape international relations, military planning, and the future of human civilization.

The technical achievement of creating nuclear weapons stands as one of humanity's greatest scientific accomplishments, while simultaneously representing our capacity for self-destruction. As we advance into an era of renewed great power competition, emerging technologies, and evolving nuclear doctrines, the importance of nuclear literacy - understanding what these weapons are, how they work, and what they can do - has never been greater.
