# Fusion

## Overview

[Nuclear fusion](/history/modern-developments/nuclear-fusion) is the process by which two light atomic nuclei combine to form a single heavier nucleus while releasing massive amounts of energy. This process powers the sun and all other stars, and represents the ultimate clean energy source for humanity.

## Fusion Process

When light nuclei undergo fusion:
- **[Nuclear](/terms/nuclear-effects/yield-comparison) combination**: Two or more light nuclei overcome electromagnetic repulsion
- **Energy release**: Mass is converted to energy according to E=mc²
- **Helium formation**: Most fusion reactions produce helium as the primary product
- **Neutron emission**: Many reactions also release high-energy neutrons

## Fusion Reactions

Common fusion reactions include:
- **Deuterium-Tritium**: ²H + ³H → ⁴He + neutron (17.6 MeV)
- **Deuterium-Deuterium**: ²H + ²H → ³He + neutron (3.3 MeV)
- **Proton-Proton**: H + H → ²H + positron + neutrino (stellar process)
- **Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen cycle**: Alternative stellar fusion pathway

## Requirements for Fusion

Fusion requires extreme conditions:
- **Temperature**: 10-100 million degrees Celsius
- **Pressure**: Extreme density to force nuclei together
- **Confinement**: Magnetic or inertial confinement to contain plasma
- **Plasma state**: Fourth state of matter with free electrons and ions

## Energy Release

Fusion energy characteristics:
- **Energy density**: 4 times more energy per kilogram than fission
- **Fuel efficiency**: Nearly 4 million times more energy than fossil fuels
- **[Binding energy](/terms/nuclear-physics/binding-energy)**: Energy comes from nuclear binding energy curve
- **Mass-energy conversion**: Small mass loss creates enormous energy

## Applications

Current and potential fusion applications:
- **Stellar energy**: Powers all stars including the sun
- **Hydrogen bombs**: Thermonuclear [weapons](/history/modern-developments/nuclear-weapons-free-zones) use fusion reactions
- **Research reactors**: Experimental facilities like ITER and NIF
- **Future power**: Potential clean electricity generation
- **Space propulsion**: Proposed fusion rocket engines

## Challenges

Major technical obstacles:
- **Ignition threshold**: Achieving net energy gain
- **Plasma stability**: Maintaining fusion conditions
- **Material science**: Reactor walls must withstand neutron bombardment
- **Energy input**: Current systems require more energy than they produce
- **Economic viability**: Cost-effective power generation remains elusive

## Relevance to Nuclear Weapons

Fusion is critical to nuclear weapons because:
- **Thermonuclear weapons**: Hydrogen bombs use fusion as primary energy source
- **Fission-fusion design**: Most modern weapons combine fission and fusion
- **Yield enhancement**: Fusion enables megaton-class weapons
- **Tritium production**: Fusion reactions can breed tritium for weapons
- **Strategic implications**: [Fusion weapons](/history/weapons-technology/fusion-weapons) changed nuclear deterrence
