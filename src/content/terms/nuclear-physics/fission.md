# Fission

## Overview

[Nuclear](/history/foundational-events/nuclear-fission-discovery) fission is a nuclear reaction where the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller nuclei, releasing enormous amounts of energy. This process powers nuclear reactors and nuclear [weapons](/terms/nuclear-effects/yield-comparison), representing one of the most significant scientific discoveries of the 20th century.

## Fission Process

### Basic Mechanism
- **Neutron absorption**: Heavy nucleus absorbs neutron
- **Nuclear instability**: Nucleus becomes unstable and elongates
- **Nuclear splitting**: Nucleus splits into two smaller fragments
- **Energy release**: ~200 MeV released per fission event
- **Neutron production**: 2-3 neutrons released per fission

### Chain Reaction
- **Self-sustaining**: Released neutrons cause additional fissions
- **Exponential growth**: Each fission can trigger multiple new fissions
- **Critical mass**: Minimum amount needed for sustained reaction
- **Control**: Neutron absorption controls reaction rate

## Fissile Materials

### Primary Fissile Isotopes
- **Uranium-235**: 0.7% of natural uranium, fissile with thermal neutrons
- **Plutonium-239**: Created in reactors, excellent fissile properties
- **Uranium-233**: Bred from thorium, high fission cross-section

### Material Properties
- **Fission cross-section**: Probability of neutron-induced fission
- **Critical mass**: Minimum mass for sustained chain reaction
- **Neutron yield**: Average neutrons produced per fission
- **Energy release**: Consistent ~200 MeV per fission

## Energy Release Mechanism

### Mass-Energy Conversion
- **Einstein's equation**: E=mcÂ² governs energy release
- **Mass defect**: Fission products have less mass than original nucleus
- **Binding energy**: Energy stored in nuclear bonds
- **Scale**: Millions of times more energy than chemical reactions

### Energy Distribution
- **Kinetic energy**: ~80% in fission fragment motion
- **Neutrons**: ~2.5% in neutron kinetic energy
- **Gamma rays**: ~2.5% in electromagnetic radiation
- **Delayed energy**: ~15% from radioactive decay

## Historical Discovery

### Key Scientists
- **Otto Hahn**: German chemist who first observed fission
- **Lise Meitner**: Physicist who explained fission mechanism
- **Otto Frisch**: Coined term "fission" and confirmed theory
- **Enrico Fermi**: Achieved first controlled chain reaction

### Timeline
- **1938**: Discovery of nuclear fission in Germany
- **1939**: Confirmation and explanation of fission process
- **1942**: First controlled chain reaction (Chicago Pile-1)
- **1945**: First [nuclear weapons](/history/modern-developments/nuclear-weapons-free-zones) used in warfare

## Applications

### Nuclear Power
- **Energy generation**: Controlled fission for electricity production
- **Reactor types**: Various designs using fission for power
- **Fuel cycles**: Mining, enrichment, and waste management
- **Global capacity**: Hundreds of reactors worldwide

### Nuclear Weapons
- **Atomic bombs**: Uncontrolled fission chain reaction
- **Weapon designs**: Gun-type and implosion mechanisms
- **Military applications**: Strategic and [tactical nuclear weapons](/terms/weapons-delivery/tactical-nuclear-weapons)
- **Proliferation concerns**: Spread of fission weapon technology

## Safety and Control

### Reactor Control
- **Control rods**: Neutron-absorbing materials to control reaction
- **Moderators**: Materials to slow neutrons for efficient fission
- **Coolants**: Remove heat and prevent overheating
- **Containment**: Structures to prevent radioactive release

### Safety Systems
- **Emergency shutdown**: Rapid insertion of control rods
- **Decay heat removal**: Cooling after reactor shutdown
- **Multiple barriers**: Defense-in-depth safety approach
- **Operator training**: Extensive training for safe operation

## Relevance to Nuclear Weapons

Nuclear fission is the fundamental process that enables nuclear weapons. [Fission weapons](/history/weapons-technology/fission-weapons) (atomic bombs) use uncontrolled chain reactions to release enormous energy in milliseconds. Understanding fission explains how nuclear weapons achieve their devastating power, why certain materials are restricted, and how nuclear technology can be both beneficial for energy and dangerous for weapons. The same physics that powers nuclear plants can create nuclear weapons, making fission knowledge both essential and carefully controlled.
