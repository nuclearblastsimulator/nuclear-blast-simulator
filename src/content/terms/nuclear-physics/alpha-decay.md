# Alpha Decay

## Overview

Alpha decay is a type of radioactive decay where an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle (helium-4 nucleus) and transforms into a different element. This process reduces the atomic number by 2 and the mass number by 4.

## The Process

When a heavy nucleus undergoes alpha decay:
- The nucleus emits an alpha particle (2 protons + 2 neutrons)
- The remaining nucleus has 2 fewer protons and 2 fewer neutrons
- The element changes to one that is 2 positions lower on the periodic table

## Alpha Particle Properties

- **Composition**: 2 protons + 2 neutrons (helium-4 nucleus)
- **Charge**: +2 (due to 2 protons)
- **Mass**: ~4 atomic mass units
- **Symbol**: α or ⁴₂He

## Penetration and Shielding

Alpha particles have limited penetrating power:
- **Range in air**: ~2-10 cm
- **Stopped by**: Paper, skin, clothing
- **Biological hazard**: Dangerous if inhaled or ingested
- **External exposure**: Generally not dangerous due to low penetration

## Examples

Common alpha emitters:
- **Uranium-238** → Thorium-234 + α
- **Radium-226** → Radon-222 + α
- **Polonium-210** → Lead-206 + α

## Applications

- **Smoke detectors**: Americium-241 alpha source
- **[Nuclear](/terms/nuclear-effects/yield-comparison) batteries**: [Plutonium](/terms/nuclear-physics/plutonium)-238 in space missions
- **Research**: Alpha particle scattering experiments

## Relevance to Nuclear Weapons

Alpha decay is important in nuclear [weapons](/terms/weapons-delivery/tactical-nuclear-weapons) because:
- Many fissile materials are alpha emitters
- Alpha decay contributes to plutonium aging
- Affects weapon reliability over time
- Creates detection challenges due to limited penetration
