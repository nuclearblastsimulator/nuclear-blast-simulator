# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the Nuclear Blast Simulator - an educational web application that visualizes the effects of nuclear weapons. It's built as a static site using Astro v5.11 with interactive features powered by vanilla JavaScript and Leaflet.js maps.

## Commands

### Development
- `npm run dev` - Start Astro development server on port 3000
- `npm run build` - Build production site to `dist/` directory
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

### Testing & Quality
There are currently no test commands configured. When implementing tests, update this section.

### Deployment
- `npm run deploy` - Deploy to Netlify (requires configuration)

## Architecture

The project uses Astro's static site generation with a clear separation between content and presentation:

### Core Structure
- **Astro Pages** (`/src/pages/`): Route-based pages that generate static HTML
  - `index.astro` - Homepage
  - `simulator/index.astro` - Interactive blast simulator
  - `terms/[...slug].astro` - Dynamic routes for glossary articles
  - `history/[...slug].astro` - Dynamic routes for history articles

- **Content Collections** (`/content/`): Educational markdown content
  - `/terms/` - Nuclear terminology articles
  - `/history/` - Historical articles organized in subcategories

- **Static Assets** (`/public/`): Served as-is without processing
  - `/assets/js/app.js` - Main simulator logic with Leaflet.js integration
  - `/assets/data/nuclear-weapons.json` - Database of 40+ nuclear weapons
  - `/assets/css/` - Compiled stylesheets

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Static Generation**: All pages are pre-built at compile time for performance
2. **No Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity to minimize bundle size
3. **Content Collections**: Astro's content system for managing educational articles
4. **Dark Theme**: Optimized for readability with nuclear subject matter

### Simulator Architecture
The blast simulator (`/public/assets/js/app.js`) implements:
- Weapon selection with yield data
- Air burst vs surface burst calculations
- Five damage zones with scientific scaling laws
- Interactive Leaflet map with custom circle overlays
- Click handlers for zone-specific information

### Build Process
1. Astro processes all `.astro` files and content collections
2. Tailwind CSS processes styles through Vite
3. Static assets are copied directly to `dist/`
4. Result is a fully static site requiring no server runtime

## Important Considerations

1. **Educational Purpose**: All features should promote understanding of nuclear weapons effects for educational purposes only
2. **Scientific Accuracy**: Blast calculations use established scaling laws (R ‚àù Y^0.33 for blast, etc.)
3. **No External APIs**: All data is bundled locally for privacy and reliability
4. **Responsive Design**: Must work on mobile devices for accessibility
5. **Performance**: Keep JavaScript minimal as users may be on slower connections
